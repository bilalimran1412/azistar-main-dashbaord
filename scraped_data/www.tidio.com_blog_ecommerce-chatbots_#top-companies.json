The potential of these virtual assistants goes beyond just their deployment, as they keep streamlining customer interactions and boosting overall user engagement.\n\n\n\nLet’s check out the key areas where ecommerce chatbots can prove to be useful.\n\n\n\nThey can:\n\n\n\nAnswer FAQs \n\n\n\nChatbots can quickly and efficiently provide answers to commonly asked questions about your products or services. Instead of expecting your service reps to handle repetitive queries, a chatbot can save time and resources by presenting customers with a knowledge base of accurate solutions, 24/7. \n\n\n\nThis frees up human agents to tackle more complex issues, enhancing the overall effectiveness and responsiveness of your customer support. And improves the service experience as nearly 60% of customers feel that long wait times are the most frustrating parts of a customer service experience. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Check out all you need to know about FAQ chatbots and learn how to use them.\n\n\n\nAutomate sales\n\n\n\nAside from being digital assistants, chatbots can also transform your sales funnel. They are capable of handling every aspect of the transaction—from product suggestions to guiding customers through the purchase process. Chatbots can process payments, provide instant confirmation, and even help with real-time order status tracking. This not only speeds up the sales process but also offers a seamless shopping experience for the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd results are clear as studies show that chatbots can increase the conversion rate by up to 67% and boost sales by a whopping 67%.\n\n\n\nRead more: Explore the best sales chatbots you can use to boost revenue.\n\n\n\nGenerate leads\n\n\n\nWhen integrated with the right software, chatbots can become lead-gathering machines. They can initiate conversations with site visitors and collect basic information like name and email address. In fact, Drift reports that 55% of businesses using chatbots have generated a greater volume of high-quality leads.\n\n\n\nAlso, they can even evaluate if a user qualifies as a potential lead using advanced AI algorithms. These leads can be synced with your CRM, ensuring a more personalized sales approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Check out our case study about how Endeksa, a real estate data analytics platform, hit a 138% boost in lead generation using Tidio.\n\n\n\nKeep customers engaged\n\n\n\nChatbots can offer personalized recommendations based on a customer’s browsing and purchase history, enhancing the relevancy of suggestions while also increasing user engagement. \n\n\n\nFurthermore, push notifications about deals, restocks, and new arrivals delivered by chatbots can keep shoppers informed and lure them back into the sales funnel. This ongoing interaction encourages repeat purchases and has the potential to boost customer loyalty in the long run. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGather customer feedback\n\n\n\nChatbots are uniquely positioned to collect valuable customer feedback. They can do this through chat surveys, polls, or simple rating systems to gather customers’ opinions post-purchase, or even during their shopping journey. Collecting this data enables businesses to uncover insights about clients’ experiences, product satisfaction, and potential areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you’re familiar with what ecommerce chatbots are good for and how they can help you get the most out of your online business.\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at some practical examples of ecommerce chatbots to see what they look like in action.\n\n\n\nBest ecommerce chatbot examples on the market\n\n\n\nDiscussing the benefits of chatbots in ecommerce is undoubtedly important.

See the bots doing their magic with your own eyes and get inspired!\n\n\n\n1. Sephora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Chatbot guide\n\n\n\nSephora was the first beauty brand and one of the first big retailers to build an ecommerce chatbot. It has two Facebook bots:\n\n\n\n\nReservation assistant—a chatbot that makes it easy to book in-store makeovers\n\n\n\nVirtual artist—a chatbot that scans your face and lets you try makeup virtually to see whether certain products work for you (such as foundations, lipsticks, and eyeshadows)\n\n\n\n\nSephora also launched a chatbot on Kik, the messaging app targeted at teens. It offers quizzes that gather information and then makes suggestions about potential makeup brand preferences. It also redirects the users to the Sephora app to make purchases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Chatbot guide\n\n\n\nDigital marketing specialists at Sephora often praise the chatbots, pointing out their ability to easily engage users, and provide them with 24/7 personalized conversations.\n\n\n\n2. H&M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Chatbot guide\n\n\n\nLike Sephora, this clothing giant launched an ecommerce chatbot on Kik. H&M’s chatbot asks a few questions about a user’s style and then sends pictures of two outfits according to their answer, allowing the person to choose a better match.\n\n\n\nThis chatbot ecommerce example can also save, share, and search for potential matching products. This way, the bot becomes a virtual stylist and helps customers avoid endless browsing of hundreds of products.\n\n\n\n3. Kiehl’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Chatbot guide\n\n\n\nKiehl’s Facebook Messenger bot offers beauty consultation and skincare matching the individual skin types. Just like a human consultant! \n\n\n\nIn addition, this ecommerce chatbot gives tips regarding skin concerns, offers the right products, and explains ingredients to the user. On top of that, the bot can take orders and send the order tracking info of the product package. To us, it sounds like a dream chatbot for all the skincare enthusiasts out there.\n\n\n\n4. Louis Vuitton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Chatbot guide\n\n\n\nThis luxury brand launched an advanced, NLP-based ecommerce chatbot that mimics the top-level customer service its customers receive in brick-and-mortar shops. LV’s chatbot can search products based on chosen criteria (type, color, size, pattern, and others), locate the shop in your area, and even give advice on product care of your items.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, you can share your finds with friends and get votes on which products to buy. And if you are curious about the history of the second-oldest luxury brand in the world, the chatbot will give you some interesting insights. Naturally, the bot also provides the handoff to the Client Advisor option. It’s a real treat for all luxury online shoppers and fashionistas.\n\n\n\n5. Procosmet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcosmet, an Italian luxury brand, uses Tidio chatbots on their company’s website for numerous purposes, including greeting users, gathering information, and tending to their questions and concerns. \n\n\n\nOne of the bots they use is an FAQ chatbot capable of answering all of the commonly asked questions. Also, they incorporated Tidio’s lead generation and newsletter bot that offers promotions to subscribers. The chatbot uses a set of available chat triggers to message and assist users in various situations during their consumer journey, increasing customer satisfaction. \n\n\n\nAll in all, Tidio’s chatbot functionalities helped the brand stabilize its conversions and see a boost in sales by a whopping 23%.\n\n\n\nRead more: Get inspired by browsing even more chatbot examples. Also, discover the best ecommerce live chat software to implement on your website.\n\n\n\nSo—how can you easily install an ecommerce chatbot on your website? Let’s look into that.\n\n\n\nHow to get a chatbot for ecommerce sites?\n\n\n\nNow that you know how the biggest brands use bots to their advantage, it’s time for the most practical part—how to create your own chatbot for ecommerce. The good news is that with Tidio, it’s super simple, and it only takes around 10 minutes.\n\n\n\nJust have a look!\n\n\n\nStep 1: Log in to Tidio\n\n\n\nFirst things first, you need to get access to your Tidio account by logging in. You can do this using your email address, Facebook, or through your ecommerce platform like Shopify or Wix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Connect your platform of choice to Tidio\n\n\n\nBefore planning to employ ecommerce chatbots on your site, you have to determine which platforms you’ll use to reach your customers. Aside from doing so directly from your site, you can also contact them using social media networks and communication apps.\n\n\n\nOnce you access the Tidio dashboard, head to the Integrations screen and connect to your desired platform by hitting the Install integration button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the networks you have at your disposal include Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Email.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Go to the Chatbots section and design your bot\n\n\n\nNow, this is possibly the most important step from our list as it lets you determine what type of chatbot you want to create. \n\n\n\nYou should know that in Tidio, there are two main types of bots you can add: rule-based and AI chatbots. \n\n\n\nIf you want to create rule-based bots—\n\n\n\nYou first need to design the conversation flows using the chatbot editor. You can do this by opening the Chatbots tab and then choosing Templates. \n\n\n\nThen, you can customize one of the available chatbot templates or you can create it from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should also get familiar with three terms:\n\n\n\n\nTrigger, which is a condition that activates the bot (i.e. if a visitor clicks a specific page)\n\n\n\nCondition, an additional parameter (i.e. a visitor’s location)\n\n\n\nAction, a node that gets the bot to work after Trigger and Condition are activated (i.e. send a greeting message).\n\n\n\n\nYou can simply drag and drop the building blocks using these nodes, then connect them to create a chatbot conversation flow. \n\n\n\nFor example, you can build an email-collecting bot that offers a discount to subscribers.\n\n\n\nTo do that, first pick a trigger (visitor opening a specific page) and select the page you want the bot to appear on. Then you should type in your bot’s message (i.e. “Hi! Do you want a discount?”) and add a Decision node (which would be visitor’s replies). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, enter the message you want the bot to send according to their reply. In this case, it would be a message for those who want a discount, and for those who aren’t interested.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is just one example of an ecommerce bot you can create using Tidio’s drag-and-drop editor. Feel free to explore available blocks to find the options that work for you.\n\n\n\nNow, if you’d rather create AI-based ecommerce chatbots—\n\n\n\nYou need to first implement Lyro, which is Tidio’s conversational AI. \n\n\n\nTo start, go to the Lyro tab and hit the button called Start using Lyro. Make sure to check out the restriction of using Lyro and then click on the Accept button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be met with two options to add your FAQs—you can choose to import an FAQ from your website’s URL or add one from an external page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s also great about Lyro is that it automatically gets the question-answer pairs from the URL you added, and then generates bots accordingly. You can use the Configure tab to edit, delete, and add any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Test your chatbot\n\n\n\nYou shouldn’t forget to test out your bot before putting it into action. This is extremely important as it ensures that your ecommerce chatbots are working as you want them to. \n\n\n\nTo do this in Tidio, just hit the Test it out button located in the upper right corner of the chatbot editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Activate your chatbot\n\n\n\nAll that’s left for you to do is activate your bot. You can do this by simply selecting the Activate button.\n\n\n\nLast but not least, you’ll be asked to give the name to your bot, as well as assign its purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that’s it! Your new ecommerce bot is all set and ready for action.\n\n\n\nRead more: Check out our in-depth article that covers all step-by-step aspects of how to create a chatbot for your online business.\n\n\n\nAnd finally—how do you make the most out of this technology?\n\n\n\nBest practices for using chatbots in ecommerce\n\n\n\nUsing a chatbot in ecommerce introduces a whole new level of customer-business interaction. To fully harness their potential, however, adopting certain practices is crucial. \n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at some tips and strategies businesses can employ to maximize the effectiveness of chatbots in ecommerce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Promote clear and immediate communication\n\n\n\nEnsure your chatbot platform for ecommerce is programmed to communicate with simplicity and precision. You should avoid using complex language or industry jargon to prevent potential misunderstandings. Moreover, create a system that sends instant replies to consumer queries in order to provide immediate solutions. As a business, you should strive to keep communication quick, relevant, and error-free through regular updates and maintenance.\n\n\n\n2. Humanize your bot\n\n\n\nA chatbot may automate the process, but the interaction should still feel human-like. This can be achieved by programming the chatbot’s responses to echo your brand voice, giving your chatbot a personality, and using everyday language. Moreover, make sure to allow an easy path for the customer to connect with a human representative when needed. Maintaining this balance will provide a better user experience.\n\n\n\n3. Personalize customer interactions\n\n\n\nMake sure your ecommerce AI provides a tailored client experience. This could range from product recommendations to special deals personalized for them. For instance, your chatbot can address the customer by their name and suggest products based on the items they have shown interest in by using their purchasing history or browsing data. If you offer a unique and personalized experience, you can heighten customer engagement and potentially boost sales. \n\n\n\n4. Always keep your bots up to date\n\n\n\nIncorporating periodic assessments of the chatbot’s performance and acting on areas of improvement is equally important. As your business evolves, so should your AI chatbot for ecommerce. Not only should you update the chatbot’s script to incorporate new products and policies, but also fine-tune its responses based on customer feedback for a better user experience. Remember—an outdated chatbot can cause frustration and lead to missed business opportunities. So, always ensure your chatbot is aligned with your offers to get the best results.\n\n\n\n5. Use it for more than customer support\n\n\n\nWhile we already mentioned this throughout the article, it would be good to emphasize it once again.
