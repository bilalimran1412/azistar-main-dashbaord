It means your business is growing and people are interested in your services. \n\n\n\nHowever, when the prospects outnumber your staff capabilities, it becomes problematic. \n\n\n\nIntegratec, a talent development platform, found a way to collect more leads without straining the customer success team while providing 24/7 support for customers. \n\n\n\nHow? Keep reading to find out!\n\n\n\nThe intuitive way to talent development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation about the company:\n\n\n\n\nIndustry: SaaS/technology\n\n\n\nStarted year: 2019\n\n\n\nSize: over 50 employees\n\n\n\nCountry of origin/headquarters: Mexico\n\n\n\nTidio products/tactics used: ticketing system\n\n\n\n\nIntegratec is a B2B SaaS company aiming to provide intuitive solutions for hiring, training, and developing human talent. \n\n\n\nThe software includes tools for performance management, tracking OKRs, collecting feedback, training personnel, creating charts, and much more. On top of that, Integratec adapts to the specific needs of the client’s business offering intuitive solutions complemented by responsive customer support.\n\n\n\nHow Integratec used Tidio to turn leads into sales\n\n\n\nThe business was receiving a high number of leads that the website forms couldn’t filter or qualify. Moreover, the brand was also getting many requests and common support questions but couldn’t track them in the system.\n\n\n\nThe solution to this problem? \n\n\n\nChatbots provided by Tidio.\n\n\n\nSo, let’s discover in more detail, how Tidio helped Integratec increase leads and improve customer support.\n\n\n\nIncrease in lead generation\n\n\n\nThe company’s sales department was getting a high number of leads, but the basic chat didn’t pre-filter them and the website forms couldn’t answer all the prospects effectively. \n\n\n\nNow, Integratec improved their lead generation using chat flows that filter the prospects and provide support at any hour of the day or night. So, when the lead gets to the customer success team, they already have all the necessary information to turn the prospect into a satisfied client.\n\n\n\n\n\n    In the sales department there was around a 25% increase in qualified leads from our website chat.\n    \n        \n        \n          \n              Roberto Coindreau              Director General at Integratec           \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved request tracking\n\n\n\nIntegratec wanted to track requests, solve frequently asked questions automatically, and offer instant solutions for leads 24/7, even when the customer success team wasn’t available. \n\n\n\n\n\n    Our customer success department was receiving a lot of requests that we couldn’t properly track so a ticketing system was a must.\n    \n        \n        \n          \n              Roberto Coindreau              Director General at Integratec           \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\nTidio has provided a help desk ticketing system for the company. The software tracks inquiries, answers commonly asked questions, and filters requests. As a result, 26% of Integratec website visitors engage with the company’s chatbot, which tags and segments them according to customer properties. This improves overall customer segmentation and provides valuable insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser friendly interface\n\n\n\nAfter three years with Tidio, Integratec staff is most satisfied with the tangible results they are able to achieve. But that’s not all—their customer service team also appreciates the easy-to-set-up and use interface, extensive support from the Tidio team, and stable pricing of the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    I like the friendly interface and the support we receive from the tech team. It’s helpful to be able to have actual meetings with the support team with Tidio+, and I like the amazing price point.\n    \n        \n        \n          \n              Roberto Coindreau              Director General at Integratec           \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\nA customer service tool with a great support team, automations, and a ticketing system can help you increase lead generation and ultimately boost revenue.\n\n\n\nAre you ready to scale your business? \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Check how Tidio can help you reach your business goals\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\nShare this article:Beata StefanowiczContent Writer at Tidio with a love for the written word.
