But how do they compare and which one is the better option for your brand?\n\n\n\nWe conducted an experiment where we put both tools to the test. Let’s see how they both performed. \n\n\n\nIn this article, we’ll compare Tidio vs Zowie based on the following categories:\n\n\n\n\nReturns \n\n\n\nProduct availability\n\n\n\nShipping \n\n\n\nFree shipping\n\n\n\nPromo codes \n\n\n\nPromo codes problem\n\n\n\nProduct questions \n\n\n\nOrder status \n\n\n\nProduct sizing\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this article is to compare Lyro vs Zowie AI based on a number of factors and scenarios. We wanted to check how the chatbots are processing human-like conversations including follow-ups and multiple questions in one sentence. Both systems received 10 questions that are common for ecoomerce stores.  \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Discover how Lyro can help your business grow\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about AI chatbots        \n            \n\n\n\n\nHere are the questions we presented Lyro AI and Zowie software with for each category:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo—\n\n\n\nLet’s get straight into the comparison.\n\n\n\nThe test was run on publicly available data and an ecommerce store True Classic. We used the data from the shop’s help center and we uploaded them to Lyro. Zowie chatbot is installed on that store. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic #1: Returns\n\n\n\nWe asked both AI systems the questions What’s your return policy if the dress I buy doesn’t fit or look as expected? Do I need to pay for the return shipping?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they responded:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nZowie ★★★★★\n\n\n\nLyro as well as Zowie AI responses were satisfactory, presenting all the necessary information in a concise and understandable manner.\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover the results Tidio’s customer experience team achieved using Lyro.\n\n\n\nTopic #2: Product availability\n\n\n\nThe next question that Tidio’s Lyro and Zowie AI received was Is the MVP polo 6 pack in stock?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they responded:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★☆\n\n\n\nZowie ★☆☆☆☆\n\n\n\nLyro was able to provide the answer but didn’t understand the product name right away. The software then asked for clarification and once it received the full name, Lyro was able to answer the question accurately and fully.\n\n\n\nZowie doesn’t cover this topic therefore rule-based chatbot took over from AI. \n\n\n\nRead more: Discover what retail chatbots are with use cases, examples, and tips.\n\n\n\nTopic #3: Shipping\n\n\n\nWe asked the AI tools Do you ship to Canada? How about Belarus? and then we followed up with a question How about Marshall Islands?\n\n\n\nHere;s how they responded:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nZowie ★★★☆☆\n\n\n\nOn the first question, Do you ship to Canada? How about Belarus? both chatbots handled it very well. But it looks like Lyro is much better at keeping the context and understands the follow-up question How about Marshall Islands?\n\n\n\nTopic #4: Free shipping\n\n\n\nLyro and Zowie chatbot got a question When free shipping is applied?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nZowie ★★★★★\n\n\n\nBoth answers were satisfactory. The systems stuck to the information from the FAQs and gave a full answer with all the necessary information.\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover what FAQ chatbots are with benefits and different types.\n\n\n\nTopic #5: Promo codes\n\n\n\nNext, we asked the AI Are there any ongoing discounts for first-time customers? and checked the responses.\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nZowie ★★☆☆☆\n\n\n\nLyro was able to answer the question and all the necessary information to the user. On the other hand, Zowie AI didn’t understand the question and defaulted to collecting the user’s contact details to send the query to one of the human agents to handle.\n\n\n\nTopic #6: Promo codes not working\n\n\n\nThe next question that Lyro and Zowie AI were asked was My promo code is not working, can you help me?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nZowie ★★☆☆☆\n\n\n\nLyro provided an answer based on available Help Center. Whereas Zowie AI seems to not fully understand the user’s problem. The software provides information related to the question but doesn’t fully resolve the issue.\n\n\n\nTopic #7: Product sizing\n\n\n\nWe then gave a more shopping assistant question, Can you advise me about the size I should buy?, for the systems to answer.\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nZowie ★☆☆☆☆\n\n\n\nZowie chatbot gave out wrong information and then defaults to sending the user to the human agent. Lyro handled the scenario well by offering necessary information as well as giving a link to additional helpful resources.\n\n\n\nTopic #8: Product questions\n\n\n\nWhat about the questions relating product recommendations. Well, we asked Lyro and Zowie \n\n\n\nCan you recommend a product for gift, that’s under $30?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ☆☆☆☆☆\n\n\n\nZowie ☆☆☆☆☆\n\n\n\nBoth chatbots failed to answer the question. \n\n\n\nTopic #9: Order status\n\n\n\nLast but not least, the systems received a question What is my order status?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nZowie ★★★★★\n\n\n\nBoth chatbots have deeper integration with Shopify and both can check the order status. \n\n\n\nNote: in the test case we didn’t place real orders to check the flow to the end. \n\n\n\nSummary: AI battle Lyro vs Zowie\n\n\n\nTidio Lyro AI chatbot seems to be better at understanding the questions, especially when it comes to follow-ups and a more human-like conversation style. \n\n\n\nHere’s a comparison table between the two software:\n\n\n\nCategoryLyroZowieReturns✅✅Product availability✅❌ShippingQuestion ✅ Follow-up ✅Question ✅ Follow-up ❌Free shipping✅✅Promo codes✅❌Promo codes not working✅❌Product sizing✅❌Product questions❌❌Order status✅✅\n\n\n\nLyro is the winner in this battle. \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Take Lyro for a test drive\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about AI chatbots        \n            \n\n\n\n\nSee you in the next round!\nShare this article:Beata StefanowiczContent Writer at Tidio with a love for the written word.
