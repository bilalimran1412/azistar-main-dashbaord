This was primarily due to the brand’s practice of distributing goods without creating its listings, allowing other sellers to create listings on their behalf. While a handful of SKUs were still generating sales, most listings were not optimized, hindering the brand’s overall sales potential.\n\nThe Solution\n\n\nTo address these challenges, we took decisive action. With the help of the brand owner, we tracked all distributors offering their goods and restricted follow-up orders for Amazon sellers. They also removed sellers who obtained their goods through unverified sources as counterfeits, ensuring only legitimate sellers represented their brand. Additionally, we focused on establishing and expanding the product catalog while the copywriting and creative department updated product pages with a fresh look and branding. The SEO team revamped the copywriting, improving the brand’s visibility. These efforts allowed the advertising team to drive traffic and capitalize on the high brand demand that was already there.\n\nThe Results \n\n\nIn conclusion, our strategic initiatives and proactive approach to addressing its challenges have led to unprecedented success. By the end of 2023, the brand achieved its highest sales in Amazon history, reaching $1.85M. Furthermore, as of Q1 2024, it continues to see impressive growth, with a 162% increase year over year. The expansion of its product catalog from 22 to 65 active listings and the significant improvement in Buy Box percentage from 45% to 95% and growth are clear indicators of the brand’s strengthened position on Amazon. This story is a compelling example of how strategic planning and decisive action can drive remarkable results and position a brand for long-term success on Amazon.\n\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\nPhone\n\n(561)-464-5333\n\nWebsite\n\nwww.pasagency.com\n\nMail\n\ninfo@pasagency.com \n\nLocation\n\n20283 FL-7, Boca Raton, FL 33498\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Name *Last Name *Phone *Email *Your Seller Display Name* *Link to one of your products or brand store on Amazon*What’s the main reason for contact?What’s the main reason for contact?I`m Looking to update my creativesI`m concerned about my advertising perfomanceI`m looking for catlog managementI want to launch on AmazonI`m lookjing for a full-service managementMy current agency is to expensiveSEND  \n \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us OnLink to FacebookLink to LinkedInLink to Instagram\n\n\nStart your Project WITH US\nReady to start your Audit?\n\n\n\nSTART YOUR AUDIT\n\n\nLet’s Contact\n\n\n\n+1 (561) 464-533\ninfo@pasagency.com\n20283 FL-7, Boca Raton, FL 33498\n\n\n\nWhat We do\n\n\n\nFull Account Management\nSEO and Listing Optimization\nPPC Campaign Management\nCreatives and Graphic Design\n\n\n\n\nListing Reinstatement\nRefunds and Reimbursement \nGrowth Strategy and Consultation\n\n\n\nWho We Are\nAbout Us\nOur Team\n\n\n\nResources\nBlog\nCase Studies\n\n \t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n\n                        © 2024, Copyright PAS Agency\n\n                        Cookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\n\n                    \n\n\t            \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\nScroll to top"
