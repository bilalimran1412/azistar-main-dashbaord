It can have multiple conversations at once, serving many customers instead of human agents. This is why chatbots for Shopify are very often used to automate customer support.\n\n\n\nBut that’s not even the best part—\n\n\n\nChatbots can also increase sales and improve user experience. As a matter of fact, customers tend to be happy with chatbot interactions. An average satisfaction rate of bot-only chats is almost 88%, which is 2% higher than satisfaction rates for chats that involve a human agent. This also explains why the usage of chatbots increased by a whopping 92% since 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut which app offers the best chatbots for Shopify?\n\n\n\nThe list of the best chatbots for Shopify\n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to worry about browsing the internet in search of a perfect candidate.\n\n\n\nWe can assure you all the apps we listed enable Shopify ecommerce owners to automate customer support, increase customer engagement and help them boost lead generation.\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look.\n\n\n\n1.

But when you decide to add a chatbot to Shopify, you need to focus on what’s the best for your ecommerce business. Here are a few tips that can help you select the best option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1: Try to find the right “value for price” balance. Before you add a chatbot to Shopify, you need to understand if the solution of your choice is within the budget range. However, don’t be biased by the price factor only. If a certain chatbot solution works better during the testing, but it’s only slightly more expensive compared to other options, it’s worth considering. \n\n\n\nTip 2: See if it offers both ready-made chatbot templates and NLP-based chatbots. You will probably understand how easy it is to create template-based chatbots as soon as you start working with them. Consequently, you might want to develop something more complex and more effective as your business grows. Why not have more flexibility and start with a platform that offers both options?\n\n\n\nTip 3: Check for integrations that are essential for your business. What is the best chatbot for Shopify? The one that fits your technological stack. Always ask yourself about what your most common communication channels are. Do your customers write to you via SMS, Instagram, or Facebook Messenger? Do you need Slack integration? Check for these integrations beforehand. \n\n\n\nTip 4: See if you can transfer chats to human agents. Even though people are getting used to the chatbot functionality, especially when it comes to online shopping assistance, 46% of consumers still think chatbots are used for stopping them from reaching a live agent. Having an option to transfer a customer to a human agent can be crucial, especially in the case of a more complex issue.\n\n\n\nTip 5: Check if it offers multichannel functionality. Switching tabs between email, live chat, and chatbot apps can become frustrating, to say the least. Solutions that offer Shopify chatbots often provide a multichannel dashboard, enabling you to connect all your channels to one dashboard. This will save you time and make the process of serving your customers more efficient.\n\n\n\n\nChatbots for Shopify: summary\n\n\n\nThat’s it! By now, you should have at least a few favorites to choose from before making a final decision.
