It usually consists of a pop-up chat button that, once clicked, displays a messaging box for your potential customers.\n\n\n\nIt’s useful when shoppers have questions about your products or need help navigating your pages. Moreover, a live chat app can provide answers to FAQs and direct people to your knowledge base for more detailed guides. \n\n\n\nLive chat is crucial for customer service in ecommerce as it improves the experience and increases trust in your online store. This can help you increase sales as buyers will feel more secure purchasing from you. \n\n\n\nThanks to ecommerce live chat, your customer support team members can monitor the system, organize inquiries, and ensure all questions and concerns are answered. Ecommerce chat can also increase your conversion rates faster than you ever thought possible.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn more about what live chat is and how it works.\n\n\n\nOkay—\n\n\n\nTo better picture what we’re talking about, here are a few real-life examples of stores with live chat:\n\n\n\n\nWhisker Bag \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhisker Bag uses its ecommerce live chat to encourage website visitors to chat with the company before the potential client leaves the store. It’s a great way to decrease bounce rates and increase conversions.  \n\n\n\nRead more: Check out this case study about how Whisker Bag boosted its email subscriptions and built a customer-centric business using ecommerce live chat.\n\n\n\n\nTymo Beauty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis ecommerce business decided to put their lead generation on autopilot by using live chat to collect prospects for them. This is an easy way to gather more email addresses of potential customers for your next marketing campaign.\n\n\n\n\nHerbal Goodness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe live chat for ecommerce on Herbal Goodness’ website provides assistance to visitors as well as collects subscribers for their mailing list. This way, Herbal Goodness supports their potential customers while, at the same time, tempts them with promotions to boost their lead generation. \n\n\n\nNow—let’s look at some of the benefits of live chat for ecommerce backed up by data.\n\n\n\nWhy is live chat for ecommerce important?\n\n\n\nThis is a common question that online businesses ask when they first hear about ecommerce chat. But once they install the chat box on their website and start using it, the results speak for themselves. Some of the most prevalent outcomes are increased sales, improved customer satisfaction, and saved time. \n\n\n\nHere are a few reasons why using ecommerce live chat software for your online store is important:\n\n\n\n\nSaves time for you and your clients\n\n\n\n\nSource: timetoreply\n\n\n\nBelieve it or not, but having to wait on hold is one of the top client frustrations when it comes to customer support. And it annoys over 33% of shoppers. On top of that, about 50% of buyers prefer to use online chat from all customer communication channels available. \n\n\n\nBy using ecommerce live chat support you can slash shoppers’ waiting times and answer customer queries more efficiently. Your support agents can also answer multiple inquiries simultaneously and see the customer’s history to solve their issues quicker. Some live chat software also provides chatbots to automate ecommerce processes and make your team’s work even more effective. \n\n\n\n\nConverts visitors into leads\n\n\n\n\nAnother one of the benefits of live chat for ecommerce is that it can help you generate leads and increase checkouts. In fact, about 4% of website visitors can turn into leads when you use live chat with chatbot capabilities. You can use this functionality by adding pre-chat forms and lead-generation bots to your pages.\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover some of the top use cases for chatbots and learn how to get the most out of your bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of increased sales—over 79% of businesses state that implementing live chat positively impacted their customer loyalty, revenue, and sales. And implementing live chat on your site might be the easiest way to improve conversion rates out there as it takes less than two minutes.\n\n\n\n\nProvides valuable insights\n\n\n\n\nCustomer insights usually consist of contact data, pages visited, and customer satisfaction. You can collect them by implementing pre-chat forms. And when it comes to pages visited, you’ll have this shown automatically on the visitor’s profile when they contact you. You can also add surveys at the end of each chat to gather more customer feedback each time they interact with you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the advantage of this? Well—for starters, over 89% of shoppers want to be able to give feedback and about 77% of buyers will have a more favorable view of your brand if you ask for their feedback. People like being listened to, so give them the opportunity to speak up. And by saving their information, you can help them better in the future to improve their experience with your store. \n\n\n\n\nHelps with proactive customer support\n\n\n\n\nThis is important because proactive chat can lead to over 105% ROI (return on investment). So, thanks to reaching out to shoppers and sending follow-ups to them, you can see your investment in the chat service pay off very quickly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s more, customers appreciate proactive communication as well. About 94% of clients to whom you reach out proactively are somewhat or very satisfied with the experience. Think about it—wouldn’t you like it if a business started chatting and checked up on you without the need to ask for it?\n\n\n\n\nShoppers expect it\n\n\n\n\nDo you expect to see a chat widget on an ecommerce website? If the answer is yes, then you’re one of the 41% of buyers who expect live chat on a business site. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd they like using it. In fact, around 82% of customers are satisfied with their live chat experience. You can compare that to the mere 61% of shoppers that are happy with their email interaction and 44% of clients that enjoyed their phone communication.\n\n\n\nAnd remember, happy client means happy business. This is shown even clearer with 91% of buyers that are more likely to make a repeat purchase with your brand after a positive experience.\n\n\n\nSo, which software to use to enjoy all these benefits of live chat for ecommerce? \n\n\n\nLet’s find out!\n\n\n\n13 best ecommerce live chat for your store\n\n\n\nThe solution you choose needs to have all the features that your business requires, match your budget, and have a friendly user interface.

These could include automated welcome messages, having a live view of your visitors, and being able to go back to your chat history.\n\n\n\nOnce you create that list, you will have a better idea of what you’re looking for in your ecommerce live chat. So, make sure the platform you choose offers all the features you need. The other functionalities will be a nice bonus, but the essential ones need to be provided.\n\n\n\n\nConsider the pricing\n\n\n\n\nYou should know your budget for this software at the start of your search. This might eliminate quite a few of the competitors. Always check if the pricing of the ecommerce live chat matches your budget and estimate the return on investment you’re looking to get. \n\n\n\nIt’s also a good idea to check if there’s a free plan or a free trial to test the system before committing to it. Once you have all the options drawn out, compare their pricing to what they offer. You might find that some providers charge way more than others for the same functionalities.\n\n\n\n\nCheck the reviews about customer support\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first use live chat software, you will need some help to get the most out of it. Some of the questions you might ask start from “how to add contacts to the system”, all the way to “where are the account settings on the dashboard?” And looking for the answers yourself will cost you too much time and frustration.\n\n\n\nSo, during your search for the best ecommerce live chat for your business, you should check the current users’ reviews about customer service. You can go onto the provider’s G2 page, scroll to the Reviews section, and search for Customer service. Then read through, starting from the most recent reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee if it offers the necessary integrations\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to use the live chat feature only on your website, or do you want to add it to your social media and other messaging platforms? \n\n\n\nYou should check if the software you’re considering has integrations with Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, and email to ensure you can sync all of your customer communication in one place. Other useful integrations include Google Analytics and Zapier to easily track your data and link to platforms easily.\n\n\n\nRead more: \n\n\n\n\nDiscover how to use the Facebook Messenger integration with live chat. \n\n\n\nLearn more about Instagram chatbots and how to use them.\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nFor a quick recap—\n\n\n\nEcommerce live chat is a messaging window on your online store’s site to interact with your website visitors and returning customers. You can use it to generate leads, boost sales, and improve customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\nTo provide the best live chat customer service, you need great software to communicate with.
