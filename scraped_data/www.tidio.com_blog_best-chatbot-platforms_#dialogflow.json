And according to a Capgemini survey of more than 12,000 consumers, 74% of them use chatbot platforms for various tasks, like researching or buying products and services online. That’s not a bad deal, is it?\n\n\n\nContrary to popular belief, AI chatbot technology doesn’t only help big brands.\n\n\n\nChatbot platforms can help small businesses that are often short of customer support staff. Bots can handle up to 80% of simple queries around the clock. Some can even solve customer complaints.\n\n\n\nIn addition to providing quick answers to your website visitors, chatbot platforms can be used for engaging customers with a welcome message, booking appointments, offering discounts, or even gauging customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\nNot to mention that some chatbot platforms provide web analytics to help you understand patterns in consumer behavior.\n\n\n\nThe hype surrounding AI chatbot platforms is very real.\n\n\n\nIt’s predicted that 95% of customer interactions will be powered by chatbots by 2025. So get a head start and go through the top chatbot platforms to see what they’ve got to offer.\n\n\n\nWithout further ado—\n\n\n\nHere’s the list of the 14 best AI chatbot platforms for your business:\n\n\n\n1.

After all, you’ve got to wrap your head around not only chatbot apps or builders but also social messaging platforms, chatbot analytics, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Machine Learning (ML).\n\n\n\nHere’s a cheat sheet you can use to weed through your options.\n\n\n\nIdentify your business needs and capabilities\n\n\n\nBefore choosing the best chatbot platform, take the time to assess your business needs and technical capabilities. Ask yourself what goals you want to achieve with the platform and what technical demands you can handle. For example:\n\n\n\n\nDo I want to use a chatbot to increase sales or automate customer service? \n\n\n\nDo I need advanced AI, ML or will a simple rule-based bot be enough?\n\n\n\nDo I need a bot embedded on a website, mobile app, or social media?\n\n\n\nDoes my bot need to integrate with other tools I’m using, e.g., customer retention software?\n\n\n\nDo I have enough technical knowledge and understanding to handle complex platforms?\n\n\n\n\nDetermine your budget\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve got the answers to these questions, compare chatbot platform prices and estimate your budget. Take into account what return on investment you’re looking for. Now, you can simply get rid of the options that don’t fit in it.\n\n\n\nChatbot agencies that develop custom bots for businesses usually drive up your budget, so it might not be a good value for money for smaller businesses.\n\n\n\nConsider the pros and cons of your options\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, visual UI chatbot builders are the best chatbot platforms for those with no coding skills. Some of them are more intuitive than others, though. Despite usually being low-cost and often free, they can achieve desired outcomes for many businesses.\n\n\n\nBots with advanced functionality can usually deliver ambitious goals. And at the same time, you get complete control over their performance. But highly developed bots require more technical programming skills. \n\n\n\nPick the chatbot provider you can trust\n\n\n\nOne of the best ways to find a company you can trust is by asking friends for recommendations. The same goes for chatbot providers but instead of asking friends, you can read user reviews. Websites like G2 or Capterra collect software ratings from millions of users. They give you a pretty good understanding of how the company deals with complaints and functionality issues.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn how Lyro successfully handled 70% of support queries and slashed first response times while still in its early stages.\n\n\n\nKey takeaways\n\n\n\nThis is the list of 14 powerful chatbot platforms to make a bot for your business:\n\n\n\n\nTidio\n\n\n\nMobileMonkey\n\n\n\nChatfuel\n\n\n\nManyChat\n\n\n\nSnatchbot\n\n\n\nAivo\n\n\n\nDialogflow\n\n\n\nEngati\n\n\n\nImperson\n\n\n\nOctane AI\n\n\n\nGenesys DX\n\n\n\nDrift chatbot\n\n\n\nPandorabots\n\n\n\nWit.ai\n\n\n\n\nEach of the chatbot platforms discussed above is unique and can help you achieve your desired outcomes.
