It helps to automate customer support by providing assistance, answering questions, and resolving issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBots in customer service easily recognize common speech patterns of visitors at different stages of their customer journey. This allows them to understand user intent and provide relevant information, freeing up human customer service agents to handle more complex tasks. \n\n\n\nNow, you should note that there are two types of chatbots most commonly used for customer service: rule-based and AI-powered bots:\n\n\n\n\nRule-based bots operate based on predefined sets of rules and decision trees. They excel at providing quick responses to frequently asked customer questions.\n\n\n\nAI chatbots leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies to simulate human-like interactions. They learn from previous conversations and understand context and user intent.\n\n\n\n\nAs such, AI bots are ideal for addressing various customer needs and resolving complex issues.\n\n\n\nTidio’s Lyro is a great example of an AI chatbot for customer service. It learns from user interactions and delivers human-like answers within seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Explore different chatbot types and learn the best ways to use them for your business. \n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nLet’s find out—which customer support chatbot software on the market offers the richest array of features. \n\n\n\nTop 10 chatbots for customer service\n\n\n\nFrom AI chatbots to automations and analytics, the tools we’ll talk about have features that will help you streamline many of the mundane support tasks.

And nobody wants to lose potential buyers because of friction in client interactions. The great news for companies is that AI customer service chatbots running on NLP technology are able to easily understand different languages and respond to visitors accordingly.\n\n\n\nThey come with multiple integrations\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter what platform your website operates on—Shopify, Wix, WordPress, or WooCommerce. There are plenty of solutions available for you to choose from. On top of that, a chatbot doesn’t have to be present only on your website. There are Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp chatbots that can help you stay in touch with your shoppers whenever they need assistance.\n\n\n\nThey give your brand a unique voice\n\n\n\nWell-designed NLP bots make your brand more human and give people a feeling they are engaging with something more than a robot. Plus, adding a bit of personality to a chatbot is sure to attract more visitors. In fact, our chatbot personality study revealed that as many as 53% of consumers build positive associations around brands whose bots use quick-witted comebacks. \n\n\n\nIt’s now clear what the key benefits of chatbots in customer service are. But what about the main features you should look for?\n\n\n\nCustomer service chatbot features\n\n\n\nWhen selecting a customer service chatbot for business, it’s important to consider key features that will enhance user experience and improve communication with your audience. Here are the top 5 chatbot features to consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Language Understanding \n\n\n\nA chatbot with the NLU feature is equipped to understand human language as well as user intent to respond in a conversational manner. This enables the bot to answer queries accurately and engage in meaningful conversations based on individual customer preferences, behavior, and past interactions.\n\n\n\nMultichannel functionality \n\n\n\nTo meet your customers where they are, your chatbot should easily integrate with various digital communication channels—from your website, mobile app, and email, to social media platforms. This crucial feature allows your business to provide consistent support, regardless of the platform your customer prefers to use, enhancing their overall user experience and satisfaction.\n\n\n\nChatbot builder \n\n\n\nAn ideal chatbot should come with an intuitive builder tool. This feature allows you to easily design, build, and customize your bot without needing extensive coding skills. It should also provide easy-to-use interfaces, drag-and-drop elements, and premade templates to speed up the chatbot creation process.\n\n\n\nRouting options\n\n\n\nCS chatbots should be able to redirect customers to human agents if they ask for information outside their knowledge scope. To be more precise, when the bot can’t handle complex inquiries or a user is dissatisfied, this feature enables the transfer of the customer to a real person.\n\n\n\nPerformance analytics \n\n\n\nA chatbot should provide valuable data and analytics about its interactions with customers. This helps you to understand visitors’ needs and preferences and make necessary improvements. The chatbot-based analytics should include the total number of conversations, answered and unanswered questions, conversations transferred to an operator, and more.\n\n\n\nOkay—\n\n\n\nIt’s time to check out what these chatbots look like in action.\n\n\n\nCustomer service chatbot examples\n\n\n\nAre there any big companies that are actively using AI customer service bots? \n\n\n\nThe answer is yes, of course. Numerous companies are leveraging the power of service bots to enhance their interactions with users and streamline operations. These AI-powered tools allow for a 24/7 assistance, quick responses to queries, and efficient problem-solving.\n\n\n\nHere are a few notable examples of chatbot use cases for customer service.\n\n\n\n1. Endeksa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndeksa, a real estate analytics platform, uses the help of the Tidio support chatbot to transform the customer service experience for their clients.

But remember to adapt your chatbot’s responses according to different interaction styles while maintaining a unified brand voice. This will help you meet clients wherever they are and ensure consistent support. \n\n\n\n3. Build interactive FAQs\n\n\n\nIt’s a good idea to ensure that your bots are ready to answer any frequently asked questions.

This can discourage the visitors from closing the page, so make sure to incorporate it as part of your virtual support strategy. \n\n\n\n5. Streamline routine tasks for efficiency\n\n\n\nCustomer service bots can be your secret weapon to tackle repetitive and time-consuming tasks.

So, you should regularly analyze interactions and gather feedback to fine-tune your chatbot’s performance. Chatbots can learn from every conversation, improving their responses and understanding over time. By identifying patterns, refining responses, and adding new capabilities, you ensure your bot evolves as your business scales, offering even better support to an expanding customer base.\n\n\n\nAll in all, by strategically integrating these virtual assistants into your support routine, you’ll be well on your way to expanding your reach while delivering a top-notch customer service experience.\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s see how you can implement a CS bot for your business needs.\n\n\n\nHow to build a customer service chatbot\n\n\n\nThe good news is that there are a number of customer service chatbot companies that let you build and install your bots with zero coding skills.

A customer service bot is a type of artificial intelligence tool programmed to interact with customers in a natural, human-like manner. These bots can conduct real-time conversations, process requests, respond to queries, and offer 24/7 assistance on different platforms. They can either operate based on a set of pre-determined instructions or utilize more advanced machine-learning algorithms for more complex interactions.  How does a customer service chatbot work? A customer service chatbot works by simulating conversations with customers through programmed responses or by learning from previous interactions. They operate with either a predefined set of rules or more advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. Rule-based bots answer queries according to specific command inputs whereas AI chatbots leverage artificial intelligence to learn from each customer interaction and adapt.   How can chatbots improve customer service? Bots can greatly improve customer service by providing instant responses and round-the-clock support. Furthermore, chatbots can handle regular queries and issues efficiently, allowing human support agents to manage more complex customer requests. They also handle transactions and provide personalized recommendations, enhancing customer experience.  Will chatbots completely replace human customer service representatives? No, they will never completely replace human representatives. Chatbots are ideal for handling routine and repetitive tasks, while support reps can focus on complex issues and provide a more human touch.   Are customer service chatbots secure? Security is a top priority in the development of customer service chatbots. Personal customer data and payment information are typically encrypted and follow rigorous data protection regulations. Also, reputable customer support chatbot providers maintain high-security measures to avoid data breaches. However, like any other digital platform, absolute safety can’t be guaranteed, so ongoing efforts are necessary to maintain and enhance security.  Do customer service chatbots require a lot of maintenance? The level of maintenance required for a bot can vary depending on the complexity of the bot. Simple, rule-based chatbots may require very little maintenance. On the other hand, more complex, AI-driven chatbots may need regular updates and supervision to ensure that they continue to learn from client interactions.   What is the best AI for customer service? Tidio’s Lyro is a notable example among the leading AI chatbots for customer service. It’s capable of pulling answers from the existing FAQ base or a company’s website.
