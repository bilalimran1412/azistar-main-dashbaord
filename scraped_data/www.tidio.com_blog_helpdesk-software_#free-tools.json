Listing them as “tickets” in an organized system makes it easier to arrange and solve the inquiries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpdesk software usually provides the ticketing feature as a solid base. On top of that, the system includes an array of other features, such as live chat, multichannel ticketing, advanced analytics, and a knowledge base. There are many types of helpdesk ticketing software—some are designed to manage client questions, and others aim to help the IT teams with internal processes.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn what the difference between help desk software and a service desk is.\n\n\n\nDifferent types of help desk systems\n\n\n\nHelp desk software can be categorized in a few different ways.\n\n\n\nOne is by the type of software:\n\n\n\n\nCloud-based—hosted online through a vendor’s site or application, you can log in and pay a monthly or yearly fee to access it\n\n\n\nSelf-hosted—also called on-premise, this software is installed directly onto your own servers, you either build it yourself or purchase it from a company\n\n\n\nOpen-source—anyone can access the source code to customize it, there is no single owner or proprietor\n\n\n\n\nYou can also divide the systems based on the relation to the intended user:\n\n\n\n\nInternal—this help desk manages IT and HR issues logged by employees and helps organize internal service requests\n\n\n\nCustomer-facing—support teams use it to manage incoming client conversations across channels; the software usually provides shared inboxes, collaboration tools, productivity features, and reporting\n\n\n\n\nThe internal vs. customer-facing categorization highlights the core purpose of the help center software. This distinction can better inform your choice based on whether you want to improve internal issue tracking or external customer support. Keep in mind that in this article, we’ll focus on the customer-facing help desk software.\n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nIt’s time to look at the best platforms you can use for your business.\n\n\n\nThe 12 best help desk software\n\n\n\nSome of the help desk solution providers pride themselves on advanced features, while others additionally offer a chat widget and automation to improve customer interactions. There are hundreds of tools available on the web, but we picked the top 12 to make the decision easier for you.\n\n\n\nHere’s a comparison table of all the platforms we go through in our list:\n\n\n\nPlatformRatingFree versionBest forTidio4.7/5 ⭐️✅AI-powered chatbots in the packageZendesk4.3/5 ⭐️❌1,000+ integrationsHubSpot4.4/5 ⭐️✅Unified customer service solutionFreshdesk4.4/5 ⭐️❌Ticket mergingHelp Scout4.4/5 ⭐️❌Robust APIHiver4.6/5 ⭐️❌Team collaboration featuresLive Agent4.5/5 ⭐️✅Multichannel supportHappyFox4.5/5 ⭐️❌Multiple ticket viewsGorgias4.6/5 ⭐️❌User-friendly featuresosTicket4.5/5 ⭐️✅Customizable viewsZoho Desk4.4/5 ⭐️✅Integrations with Slack, Jira, Salesforce, GoogleJira Service Management4.2/5 ⭐️✅Request queues\n\n\n\nLet’s discover each one of them in more detail.\n\n\n\n1.

But you have to keep the end-users happy to boost their loyalty and satisfaction with your brand. Forums are not gonna cut it, but a good help desk tool can increase the productivity of your agents, assist you with metrics, and improve your overall customer relationships. \n\n\n\nHere are the main benefits of a help desk solution:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased productivity \n\n\n\n\nHelp desk support services unburden your team by automating time-consuming tasks like categorizing, assigning, and reassigning issues. This allows your agents to focus on resolving customer inquiries. In fact, 93% of teams reported increased productivity after implementing help desk software.\n\n\n\n\nSaved time and reduced costs \n\n\n\n\nStudies show that helpdesk software can save up to 670 working hours per year compared to manually handling tickets. It also resolves 22% of all service desk tickets at no cost through automation. The manual cost per ticket is $22.\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge base creation\n\n\n\n\nThe data from helpdesk software helps identify common customer issues. You can use these insights to create knowledge base articles and improve self-service options. \n\n\n\n\nPerformance insights \n\n\n\n\nHelp desk applications provide reporting on key metrics like resolution time, customer satisfaction, and agent productivity. This allows you to optimize your customer service operations.\n\n\n\n\nImproved customer relationships \n\n\n\n\nFeatures like ticketing history and identity management help provide personalized service across communication channels. In fact, 66% of customers say this is important for building trust and loyalty.\n\n\n\nNow that you know the advantages of having help desk support software, let’s have a look at the features you should keep an eye out for.\n\n\n\nMain features of help desk software\n\n\n\nDashboards, asset management, ticket escalation management, apps for iOS and Android… \n\n\n\nTake your pick. What’s the most important one for your business? Maybe it’s all of them?We found that ticket management, multichannel support, integrations, and automation capabilities are the most useful features in a help desk solution for any business. Let’s look at them in more detail.\n\n\n\nTicket management \n\n\n\nRobust tools for tagging, categorizing, assigning, and routing tickets are crucial for organized issue resolution. Agents should be able to easily update ticket status, priority, owner, and details. Custom ticket fields and views also help agents manage their workflows more efficiently. On top of that, advanced ticket management makes it easier for teams to collaborate on resolving customer issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultichannel support \n\n\n\nMake sure your helpdesk software can handle customer inquiries from various channels like email, chat, social media, and self-service. Consumers expect unified support across all the channels they use. Multichannel capabilities centralize all interactions under each ticket for continuous conversations and allow you to see where customers reach out to you from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrations \n\n\n\nYour helpdesk software should integrate with other essential tools your business uses like CRM, ecommerce, or accounting platforms. Integrations avoid switching between systems and synchronize data. Key customer information should flow into helpdesk tickets seamlessly and support agents should be able to access details without disruption to serve customers better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomation \n\n\n\nOpt for helpdesk software with capabilities like auto-replies, ticket assignment rules, and status updates to reduce repetitive tasks. An automated help desk ensures tickets are routed properly and agents focus on higher-value work. It also makes the management of high ticket volumes more efficient. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, but how to know which platform is best for your business needs? \n\n\n\nLet’s look into that.\n\n\n\nHow to choose the right help desk tool for your business?\n\n\n\nDifferent businesses have unique needs when it comes to helpdesk software. Make sure to assess your requirements to pick the solution that works best for you.\n\n\n\nHere are some considerations based on company size:\n\n\n\n\nSmall business\n\n\n\n\nA small business needs affordable, web-based helpdesk software with essential features. As ticket volume is low, advanced enterprise-level capabilities are unnecessary. Prioritize an intuitive interface, email management, and light reporting. Tidio, HelpScout or Freshdesk are good choices here.\n\n\n\n\nMedium business\n\n\n\n\nAs your company grows, look for helpdesk software with more robust functionality. Medium businesses benefit from additions like multichannel support, automated workflows, and expanded analytics. Platforms like Zendesk or HubSpot provide these features at a mid-tier price point.\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise business\n\n\n\n\nLarge corporations require scalable helpdesk software with deep customization and integration capabilities. Opt for an enterprise-level tool like FreshDesk and Gorgias that offers VIP support services and extensive configurations. These systems can handle high ticket volumes across regions, products, and brands.\n\n\n\nRegardless of your size, define your must-have capabilities and ideal features. This ensures that you select helpdesk software that meets current needs and is able to scale up as your business grows. Also, prioritize an intuitive solution requiring minimal training and IT support.\n\n\n\nWhen you find the right solution for your business, you should try to get the most out of it. Let’s check out some help desk best practices that can help you with that.\n\n\n\nHelp desk software: best practices\n\n\n\nManaging support tickets and ensuring they go to the right team members is a hard job. Luckily, this kind of system can do that for you. You just need to set it up correctly.So, here are a few tips to follow when implementing your help desk software solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrain support agents\n\n\n\n\nIt’s crucial to thoroughly train all support agents on the features and capabilities of your helpdesk software. Comprehensive training enables agents to fully utilize the platform when assisting customers. Agents should be knowledgeable about all aspects of the system, including ticketing, automation, reporting, and integrations. Ongoing training is also important whenever new features or updates are added to the helpdesk software.\n\n\n\n\nIdentify sales opportunities \n\n\n\n\nSmart use of helpdesk software data allows you to uncover potential sales opportunities with customers. By analyzing ticket details and information, you can identify customer needs or issues that present opportunities for cross-sells or upsells. Your sales team can then reach out to the client with special offers tailored to them. This results in more revenue without additional extensive sales efforts.\n\n\n\n\nGather customer feedback \n\n\n\n\nIt’s very beneficial to survey shoppers regarding satisfaction levels after ticket resolution. Customer feedback provides insights into areas where agent performance and the service can improve. Feedback can be gathered through surveys, review forms, or emails from the helpdesk software itself. The data can then be used to optimize processes, training, and staffing.\n\n\n\n\nCreate knowledge base content \n\n\n\n\nHelpdesk software provides the ability to identify frequent customer questions, issues, and needs. This valuable information can be leveraged to create knowledge base articles and self-service content. Customers appreciate answers to common questions being available 24/7 through knowledge bases. The knowledge base also reduces future tickets on repetitive topics, saving agents time.\n\n\n\nNow, it’s time to implement the system on your site. Here’s how you can do that.\n\n\n\nHow to implement help desk software on your site?\n\n\n\nTo start managing support requests from your clients, you need to set up the platform first.\n\n\n\nWe’ll be using Tidio’s help desk ticketing system for this quick guide as it’s easy to use and you can start on a free plan without the need to provide your credit card information.\n\n\n\nHere are 3 steps to implementing help desk software.\n\n\n\n1. Sign up to the platform\n\n\n\nGo to Tidio’s register page and sign up for free. All you need is an email address and to create a password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also find the plugin on WordPress, Shopify, or other ecommerce website that you’re using. \n\n\n\n2. Connect your mailbox\n\n\n\nGo to Settings and choose the Ticketing section in your admin panel. Click on the Connect your email button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it’s done, you’ll see all the tickets in the Tickets section of your Tidio’s panel. All the new tickets will go into the Unassigned folder.\n\n\n\n3. Integrate other platforms\n\n\n\nConnect any channels and platforms that your company uses to get omnichannel customer service. Go to Integrations and pick the one you want to connect. And don’t worry if it’s not there—you can use Zapier to integrate any platform you need to Tidio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, your help desk solution is ready. You can play around with adding a live chat widget to your site, implementing FAQ chatbots for automation, and much more.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that this is not a system for the IT teams to help with IT service management. This platform focuses on helping you organize and handle customer requests.\n\n\n\nHelp desk software: key takeaway\n\n\n\nCall center is in the past. IT help desk software can help you with incoming queries, organization, and even incident management.\n\n\n\nSo, to summarize—the best help desk system solutions are:\n\n\n\n\nTidio\n\n\n\nZendesk\n\n\n\nHubSpot\n\n\n\nFreshDesk \n\n\n\nHelp Scout\n\n\n\nHiver\n\n\n\nLive Agent\n\n\n\nHappyFox\n\n\n\nGorgias\n\n\n\nosTicket\n\n\n\nZohoDesk\n\n\n\nJira\n\n\n\n\nSome of the main features you should look out for are ticket management, multichannel capabilities, automation, and a variety of integrations for better project management.
