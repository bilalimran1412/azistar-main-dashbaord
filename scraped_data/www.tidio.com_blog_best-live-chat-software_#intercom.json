To ensure an unbiased outcome, we set a strategic methodology and based our ranking on product data. \n\n\n\nThe rating factors included:\n\n\n\n\nNumber of reviews on third-party sites\n\n\n\nRatings on third-party websites, such as G2\n\n\n\nPaid plans and the free chat options\n\n\n\nGeneral features\n\n\n\nUser’s opinions of the software\n\n\n\n\nAfter the analysis, we also tested the customer service chat software using the free trial period. This has led us to the list you can see in this article. We’ve placed the tools in order of best ratings with the highest number of reviews. \n\n\n\nBut before we look at them properly, let’s check— \n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of live chat software for a website?\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot in it for your business and your customers, but let’s see what the research says on that topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased customer satisfaction\n\n\n\n\nA study shows that over 84% of customers are satisfied with live chat as a tool to communicate with businesses. So, by adding this tool to your website, you can grow the overall customer satisfaction with your business.\n\n\n\n\nReal-time customer support\n\n\n\n\nLive chat on site is the fastest customer service channel, with some studies putting the response time at 7 seconds. You can also provide real-time support and share promotions using the pop-up chat window—60% of shoppers appreciate personalized promotions and deals. \n\n\n\n\nCustomer communication on the go\n\n\n\n\nTimely in-app notifications of new visitors and incoming messages can help you improve your customer relationships and, ultimately, grow sales. It’s also good to keep in mind that over 41% of your shoppers expect a website chat feature when browsing ecommerce sites.\n\n\n\n\nValuable customer information produced\n\n\n\n\nLive chat allows you to see which pages your customers visited, their demographics, and what device they use for browsing. And while collecting the information, you can also improve your customer support as the satisfaction rate of website live chat services is about 85%.\n\n\n\n\nLead generation & increased sales\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Forrester’s study, visitors who have a conversation with a business are nearly three times as likely to convert than those who don’t. These customers also tend to buy around 10-15% more than clients who don’t use live chat.\n\n\n\nWe only scratched the surface here when it comes to live chat trends and statistics.
