It uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to engage in conversations, answer questions, and perform various tasks.\n\n\n\nThese bots can be used for customer service, marketing, entertainment, or information dissemination on platforms like Facebook Messenger, X, Instagram, or WhatsApp. And unlike human agents, chatbots can operate round the clock, providing instant responses to user queries.\n\n\n\nBut how do they work exactly, and which option is the best for your business?\n\n\n\nRead on.\n\n\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover:\n\n\n\n\nHow do social media chatbots work\n\n\n\nBest social media platforms on the market\n\n\n\nHow to implement one for your business\n\n\n\nBest practices and tips for deployment\n\n\n\nBusiness benefits of social media chatbots\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to find out more about different social media chatbots, check out these articles:\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Chatbot: A Complete Guide for Your Business\n\n\n\nWhat Are Instagram Chatbots and How to Use Them?\n\n\n\nHow To Create A WhatsApp Chatbot in 8 Steps [Free & No-Code]\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Try the best social media chatbot for your business\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\n\n\n\nBefore we jump to the in-depth reviews of the software, let’s first understand how it works.\n\n\n\nHow do chatbots for social media work?\n\n\n\nSocial media chatbots work through a combination of technologies and processes.\n\n\n\nThese include:\n\n\n\n\nNatural language processing—allows chatbots to understand and interpret customers messages as well as intent\n\n\n\nMachine learning algorithms—help the bots to learn from interactions and improve their responses over time\n\n\n\nRule based chatbots—operate on predefined rules and decision trees to provide appropriate responses\n\n\n\nResponse generator—lets the bots create responses to the user query based on the input interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn top of that, chatbot analytics help you monitor the system’s performance to identify any areas for improvement.\n\n\n\nChatbots use integrations and APIs to connect to social media platforms seamlessly. Moreover, they can also link to databases containing information like FAQs, product details, or customers data to retrieve relevant information to answer queries or personalize responses.\n\n\n\nSome of you might wonder what’s the difference between social media chatbot vs. social media bot. Let’s have a quick look at both with their use cases.\n\n\n\n Social media chatbotSocial media botInteractionsInteractive—designed for two-way conversations with usersAutomated actions—performs predefined tasks without engaging in conversationsPurposePrimarily for customer service, support, or engagementOften used for content distribution and data collectionFunctionalityResponds to user queries and can handle complex interactionsPosts content, likes posts, follows accounts, and gathers informationVisibilityUsually operates in private messages or dedicated chat interfacesGenerally operates publicly on social media platformsActivationUser-initiated—typically activated when a user reaches out or starts a conversationSelf-initiated—often runs on schedules or triggers, not requiring user interactionPersonalizationOften provides personalized responses based on user inputCan interact with the platform itself, not just users \n\n\n\nThe main difference lies in their primary function. Chatbots are designed for conversation and direct interaction with customers, while social media bots are typically used for automated tasks that don’t necessarily involve dialogue.\n\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s check the detailed reviews of the top social chatbots available on the market today. \n\n\n\nBest social media chatbots\n\n\n\nAnswering customer queries straight through the DMs or sending customers to your knowledge base using a simple link insertion are two of the most common use cases of the social bots. You can also utilize your intelligent virtual assistants to interact with clients through automatic replies to story reactions. \n\n\n\nTo do that, though, you need a platform that can help you easily deploy such chatbot. That’s why we complied a handy list of the best social media chatbots in the market along with their pros, cons and pricing, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n\nHere’s a comparison table for a quick look:\n\n\n\nPlatformG2 ratingFree planBest forTidio4.7/5 ⭐️ ✅NLP technology & conversational AIChatfuel4.5/5 ⭐️❌Extensive onboarding materialCustomers.ai4.8/5 ⭐️✅Keyword recognition systemWATI4.6/5 ⭐️❌WhatsApp integrationManychat4.6/5 ⭐️✅Customer segmentation tools\n\n\n\nNow, let’s jump into reviews:\n\n\n\n1.

Let’s have a look at a step-by-step guide.\n\n\n\nHow to implement social media chatbots\n\n\n\nWhether your chatbot marketing strategy is to collect customer feedback or upsell using social media channels, you need to first create the bots and then connect your system to the social platforms. Here’s how you can do that.\n\n\n\n1. Sign up for your chosen platform\n\n\n\nGo to the registration page and create a free account using your email, Facebook, or Shopify credentials. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Set up your chat widget and customize it \n\n\n\nPersonalize your live chat widget during the registration tour. You can add chat to your website, but it’s optional if you’re only creating Messenger and Instagram bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Connect the virtual assistant with your Facebook business page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Tidio dashboard, go to Settings and click on the Channels tab. Then, choose Facebook Messenger. Log in to Facebook, select the pages to integrate with Tidio, and grant necessary permissions. Save the changes when the integration confirmation appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Design your conversation flows \n\n\n\nUse templates or create advanced AI-driven chatbots by implementing your FAQs to Lyro. You can also customize the chat scripts to align with your business needs for better user interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Activate your Facebook bot \n\n\n\nAfter finalizing your chatbot decision trees, activate your bot. The bot will send a welcome message to visitors on your Facebook page and answer their questions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can answer customer questions automatically.\n\n\n\nBut to make your virtual assistant a success, you should follow some best practices. Let’s have a look at those.\n\n\n\nSocial media chatbot: best practices\n\n\n\nCustomer interactions, product recommendations, support services are all probably a part of your social media marketing plan. But when it comes to the chatbot, there are specific areas you should pay a closer attention to. \n\n\n\nHere are five best practices for social media chatbots:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Clearly state to users they’re interacting with a chatbot\n\n\n\nTransparency is crucial in maintaining user trust. Therefore, you should ensure that users know they’re interacting with an AI-powered chatbot, not a human. This can be done through an initial greeting message or a clear label in the chat interface. Being upfront about the bot’s nature sets appropriate expectations for the interaction and helps users understand the capabilities of the system they’re engaging with.\n\n\n\n2. Provide easy access to human support\n\n\n\nWhile chatbots can handle many queries, there will always be situations that require human intervention. So, remember to implement a clear and simple way for users to escalate their conversation to a human agent when needed. This could be through a specific command, a button in the interface, or by having the automatically offer live agent support when the bot recognizes it’s unable to assist. \n\n\n\n3. Personalize interactions based on user data\n\n\n\nLeverage available user data to provide personalized responses and recommendations. This could include using the user’s name, referencing their past interactions, or tailoring suggestions based on their preferences or purchase history. Personalization makes the interaction feel more natural and relevant, increasing user engagement and satisfaction. However, be mindful of privacy concerns and ensure you’re using data in a way that users have consented to.\n\n\n\n4. Continuously update and improve the chatbot\n\n\n\nThe effectiveness of a chatbot depends on its ability to accurately understand and respond to user queries. You should regularly analyze chat logs to identify common issues, misunderstandings, or gaps in the bot’s knowledge. Then, use this information to update the bot’s responses, expand its capabilities, and refine its language processing. \n\n\n\n5. Design a natural conversation flow\n\n\n\nInstead of focusing solely on providing accurate answers to individual questions, design your chatbot to guide users through a coherent conversation flow. This includes anticipating follow-up questions, providing relevant additional information, and guiding users towards resolving their issues or completing desired actions. \n\n\n\nRead more: See how to design an appropriate chatbot flowchart for your needs.\n\n\n\nSince you know how to exceed customer needs and enhance your social media management, let’s now look at the advantages of this technology for your brand. \n\n\n\nBenefits of social media chatbots\n\n\n\nBoost in customer engagement, increase in lead generation, higher conversion rates, and improved user experience are the main pros of using a social media strategy enhanced by bots.\n\n\n\nHere are five benefits of social media chatbots backed by data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. 24/7 availability\n\n\n\nSocial media chatbots provide round-the-clock customer service, ensuring that users can get help and all necessary information at any time of the day. This improves customer satisfaction and helps businesses capture leads that might otherwise be lost due to timing constraints.\n\n\n\nAnd according to a recent study, 64% of internet users say 24-hour service is the best feature of chatbots.\n\n\n\n2. Increased efficiency and cost savings\n\n\n\nBy handling routine inquiries and tasks automatically, chatbots free up human agents to focus on more complex issues. This can lead to significant cost savings for businesses, as they can handle a higher volume of interactions with fewer staff members.\n\n\n\nIn fact, reports say that chatbots save about $7.3billion for businesses.\n\n\n\n3. Scalability\n\n\n\nChatbots can handle multiple conversations simultaneously, allowing businesses to scale their customer service operations without a proportional increase in costs. This is particularly beneficial during peak periods or sudden spikes in inquiries.\n\n\n\n4. Improved response times\n\n\n\nChatbots can provide instant responses to user queries, dramatically reducing wait times compared to traditional customer service channels. The quick response time can significantly enhance the experience and engagement of your target audience.\n\n\n\nIt’s good to note that a study by Comm100 found that chatbots can answer up to 80% of routine questions in real-time.\n\n\n\n5. Data collection and insights\n\n\n\nThrough their interactions with users, chatbots can collect valuable data on customer preferences, common issues, and frequently asked questions. This information can be used to improve products, services, and overall customer experience.\n\n\n\nSocial media: key takeaways \n\n\n\nSocial media chatbots are software designed to interact with users on platforms like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram.\n\n\n\nThey offer automated responses to queries, provide support, and facilitate various tasks. And the main benefits include 24/7 availability, improved response times, increased efficiency, valuable data collection, and cost-effective scalability.\n\n\n\nThe best social media automation chatbots are:\n\n\n\n\nTidio\n\n\n\nChatfuel\n\n\n\nCustomers.ai\n\n\n\nWATI\n\n\n\nManychat\n\n\n\n\nTo maximize the system’s effectiveness, businesses should clearly communicate with users, ensure easy escalation to human support, and continuously update the bot’s knowledge base. As digital interactions continue to evolve, social media chatbots are becoming increasingly crucial for businesses looking to enhance customer engagement and streamline their operations.\n\n\n\nWhy not try it for yourself?\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Improve your social media presence using chatbots\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\n\n\n\nSocial media chatbots: FAQs\n\n\n\nWhat is a social media chatbot?
