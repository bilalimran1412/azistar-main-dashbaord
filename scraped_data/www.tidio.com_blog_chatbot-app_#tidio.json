Give It a Personality\n\n\n\nHow Much Does It Cost to Build a Chatbot?\n\n\n\nChatbot Marketing 101\n\n\n\n\nBefore we move on, let’s quickly answer some basic questions—\n\n\n\nWhat is a chatbot app?\n\n\n\nA chatbot app is a computer program that uses text or voice commands to simulate a human conversation. It does it by sending automated messages, offering decision buttons, and synthesizing voice. Some chatbot apps use artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize the user’s intent and offer appropriate replies. \n\n\n\nWhat chatbot apps can do for your business?\n\n\n\nChatbots are effective in resolving customer service issues about 87% of the time. So, your representatives can focus on more complex problems while chatbots take care of the simpler or repeating questions. This way, your business can improve its customer interactions and client satisfaction. \n\n\n\nWhat other uses do chatbot apps have?\n\n\n\nChatbot apps have many different uses. For example, they can become your AI friends if you have no one to talk to, or they can help you keep an eye on your health. In fact, research shows that using a chatbot for healthcare purposes can have multiple benefits, like anonymity or real-time interactions. Chatbots can help people with some health issues but they can’t be treated as a replacement for a real doctor. \n\n\n\nIn our article, we focus mostly on business-oriented chatbot apps but we also cover AI-friend apps and medical chatbots.\n\n\n\nHere’s a handy table with the best chatbot apps:\n\n\n\nNameApp Store ratingsFree planBest forTidio4.8/5 (4,800 ratings)✅Small to medium businessesZendesk4.6/5 (589 ratings)❌International companiesWatino ratings available❌WhatsApp communicationDrift4.7/5 (1,000 ratings)✅Enterprise companiesChatfuelNo ratings available✅Customer service via Facebook MessengerManyChat4.6/5 (189 ratings)✅Social media marketingCleverbot3.3/5 (434 ratings)❌Talking about anythingReplika4.6/5 (178,700 ratings)✅Creating an AI friendBabylon Health4.8/5 (3,500 ratings)✅Instant access to health careFlorenceno ratings available ✅Pill reminders and general health tracking\n\n\n\nLet’s jump into it and find out which chatbot app is the best for your needs.\n\n\n\nCheck out some interesting research-based customer service statistics, from customer expectations to business strategies.\n\n\n\n1.

Cleverbot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings: 3.3/5 (434 ratings)\n\n\n\nCleverbot, in contrast to the apps reviewed so far, isn’t a business-oriented bot but rather a conversational app for everyday use. It is a chatbot app for iOS that is specifically designed for Apple devices and uses machine learning. You can change the shade of the chat bubbles to suit your mood and message anything you like to the bot.\n\n\n\nBut be careful– It learns with every interaction with humans.\n\n\n\nThis means that when you message the bot, its algorithm selects a previously entered phrase from its database as a response. So, you might find Cleverbot’s responses strange and sometimes even inappropriate. The bot doesn’t understand emotions and will often misinterpret what you’re saying or what you mean. \n\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n\n\nResponses based on previous conversations\n\n\n\nShare fun conversations by email or on social media\n\n\n\nStop and start conversations whenever you like\n\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n\n\nOnly available on iOS\n\n\n\n18+ and can be inappropriate\n\n\n\nOnly available when you’re online\n\n\n\n\nPrice:\n\n\n\n\nDownload for $0.99\n\n\n\n\n8.
