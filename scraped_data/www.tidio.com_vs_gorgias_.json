However, we recommend you check out this comparison hosted by G2  , a third-party website, and our Shopify reviews - Tidio, Gorgias – to draw your own conclusions.Why do Shopify owners switch from Gorgias to Tidio?Cost is the most cited reason. A limited Gorgias plan that includes some basic automations usually costs more than a full-featured Tidio plan that includes advanced automation and conversational AI.The second most cited reason is the lack of support. It’s funny how Gorgias, a tool that positions itself as a top customer service tool doesn’t offer top customer service for its own customers, isn’t it?Is Tidio or Gorgias better for small Shopify stores?At Tidio, we’re dedicated to helping new businesses grow. That’s why we offer three free-forever plans you can combine to support your customers. Gorgias doesn’t offer anything for free. In addition, Tidio plans usually offer the same features as Gorgias ones at half the cost. And if you need any proof, just take a quick look at the Gorgias pricing and Tidio pricing pages and answer your own question.Gorgias claims Tidio’s Shopify-dedicated actions don’t work. Is that true?It’s common for inferior brands to slander their betters, and we’re aware Gorgias does this both on their website and during their sales calls. But that claim is definitely not true. As Gorgias recommends on their own comparison page, please ask your Tidio representative to demonstrate our native Shopify integration – most users actually find it superior to anything Gorgias offers.Does Tidio support custom integrations?Of course we do. Tidio+ customers work with our integration team and we integrate Tidio with all the apps in your business ecosystem.Tidio>VS>GorgiasTidioAbout usContactPartner ProgramsJobs – We're hiring!SecurityStatus PageProductPricingLyro AI ChatbotLive ChatFlowsHelp DeskTidio+All featuresProduct UpdatesIntegrationsShopifyWordPressAll platformsMessengerInstagramWhatsAppAll appsResourcesAll ResourcesBlogCase StudiesHelp CenterTidio vs. GorgiasTidio vs. IntercomTidio vs. LiveChatTidio vs. ZendeskHelp CenterInstallationGet StartedIntegrationsFlows setupDevelopersContact salesPricing★★★★★★★★★★4.7 on Shopify4.7 on G24.8 on CapterraJoin 300k+ businesses that use TidioImprove your business with sales, support, and customer service automationGet started freeAvailable on:BrowserAndroidiOSWindowsMacCHATBOTBest AI ChatbotsHow to Create a ChatbotBest Chatbot AppsBest Chatbot BuildersBest AI Chatbot PlatformsLIVE CHATFree Live Chat SoftwareHow to Add Live Chat to a WebsiteEcommerce Live ChatBest Live Chat SoftwareLive Chat for SalesCUSTOMER SERVICEBest Help Desk SoftwareChat Widgets for WebsitesLive Chat for Customer ServiceWordPress Chatbot PluginsCustomer Service ChatbotsSALESEcommerce Chatbots Real Estate ChatbotsSales ChatbotsChatbots for BusinessBest Real Life ChatbotsPLATFORMSShopify Live Chat AppsShopify Chatbot AppsWordPress Chat PluginsSquarespace Chat PluginsMagento Live Chat ExtensionsCHANNELSInstagram ChatbotsFacebook Messenger ChatbotWhatsApp ChatbotInstagram Bots for ReactionsWhatsApp AutomationsTidio 2024.
