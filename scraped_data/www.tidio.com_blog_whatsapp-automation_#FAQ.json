And it’s easy to use so you won’t need any extra staff to handle it. \n\n\n\nSo, let’s get into it.\n\n\n\nIn this article:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is WhatsApp automation?\n\n\n\nTop real-life use cases\n\n\n\nHow to create WhatsApp automation\n\n\n\nBest software to use\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Experience the benefits of WhatsApp automation now\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in chatbot integrations with other platforms, check out these articles:\n\n\n\n\nWhat Are Instagram Chatbots and How to Use Them?\n\n\n\n7 Best Facebook Bots [And How to Make Your Own]\n\n\n\n10 Best Shopify Chatbot Apps for 2023 [Ranking]\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the biggest question—\n\n\n\nCan you automate WhatsApp messages? \n\n\n\nYes, you can. But first, let’s find out what these automations are.\n\n\n\nWhat is WhatsApp automation?\n\n\n\nWhatsApp automation refers to the process of using software to automate messages and communication with clients. This helps businesses handle repetitive tasks, manage customer queries, and deliver quick and personalized responses on autopilot. WhatsApp automation saves business resources, improves response time, and boosts customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how does Whatsapp automation work?\n\n\n\nFirst, third-party platforms integrate with WhatsApp API (Application Programming Interfaces). This allows users to use WhatsApp automation in the following ways:\n\n\n\n\nChatbots—automated programs designed to simulate human conversation that can respond to commonly asked queries and provide real-time customer support\n\n\n\nNotifications—automated reminders and updates that can be sent to users at predetermined times or triggered by certain events\n\n\n\nWorkflow automation—a systematic way to organize work and tasks that include automated responses to specific keywords and automatic message scheduling\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s see it in action.\n\n\n\nTop 6 use cases of WhatsApp automation\n\n\n\nQuick replies, opt-in messages, and automatic reminders are some of the most popular use cases when automating your WhatsApp Business app.\n\n\n\nHere are six more examples you can implement for the cause:\n\n\n\n1. Send WhatsApp greeting messages\n\n\n\nDid you know that people who receive a greeting message are about 33% more engaged with the brand in the long term? Acknowledging visitors and making them feel welcome goes a long way. So, one of the key advantages of automated WhatsApp messages is the ability to instantly address customer inquiries, building trust and enhancing the overall customer experience.\n\n\n\nWhen automating WhatsApp messages, you can send welcome messages to the visitors who have provided you with their number, without the agent’s interference. These simply serve the purpose of greeting customers, making them feel welcome, and creating a real connection with them. \n\n\n\nYou can include essential information in these messages, as well as links and even discount codes for new clients. Just make sure your text is genuine, matches the brand voice, and feels friendly. \n\n\n\nHere’s an example of this message from Fresh & Hearty:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Leverage WhatsApp marketing automation\n\n\n\nHow about sending your promotions, deals, bestsellers, and new releases straight to your customers’ phones? \n\n\n\nThink about it. We use our phones for hours every day and when we get a notification, there’s an urge to see what it’s about. So, it’s much easier to get shoppers to check out your marketing material when it’s sent to their WhatsApp. \n\n\n\nHere’s how Deyga Organics uses WhatsApp automated messages to spread the word about their discount:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Provide instant checkouts\n\n\n\nWhatsApp automation for checkout is becoming popular in an increasing amount of countries. It’s convenient, fast, and easy for the users while boosting the revenue of the businesses. So, no wonder both sides like it.\n\n\n\nHere’s how it looks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Did you know that…    A survey by UiPath found that businesses can save $1.5 million per year on average by automating processes. With the help of WhatsApp automation software, businesses can reduce manual labor, eliminate the need for physical infrastructure, and optimize resource use. \n\n\n\n\n4. Send appointment reminders to customers\n\n\n\nSend your clients a reminder about their appointment a day before, so they can remember about it or reschedule if they can’t make it anymore. This way, you’ll lower the number of people who didn’t show up for an appointment and improve the experience of your clients. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Enable scheduling of meetings \n\n\n\nYou can let customers schedule their appointments straight through the automated message. WhatsApp automation is easy to use, so your clients will have no problems setting up a booking with your business for a demo, a haircut, or a house consultation. \n\n\n\nThis can help you increase the number of your bookings, boost conversion rates, and ensure that everything is organized well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Set up a support questions responder\n\n\n\nOver 32% of people contacting a business expect a reply within 30 minutes, indicating that quick and efficient responses to customer queries are essential. Automated WhatsApp messages for businesses can handle commonly asked questions within seconds.\n\n\n\nThis helps companies become more efficient at answering user queries and delegating tasks of higher importance to human agents. Plus, it improves customer engagement with your brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n    By automating our WhatsApp communication, we are able to promptly respond to customer queries and provide personalized assistance, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n    \n        \n        \n          \n              Andrei Vasilescu              Co-Founder & CEO of  DontPayFull          \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\nCheck out how Freedom mobile uses these WhatsApp automatic messages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay—\n\n\n\nBut how to make this automatic WhatsApp messaging?\n\n\n\nLet’s find out.\n\n\n\nHow to create WhatsApp automation?\n\n\n\nTo automate WhatsApp for your small or larger ecommerce business, you should pick a tool that matches your needs. We’ll use Tidio for this tutorial as it’s straightforward and simple to use.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Automate your WhatsApp in less than 10 minutes\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\n\n\n\nJust make sure to open a WhatsApp Business account before proceeding with the steps as this is one of the requirements for the setup of WhatsApp Business automation.\n\n\n\n1. Set up a WhatsApp away message\n\n\n\nYou can set up your away message in 4 simple steps:\n\n\n\n\nGo to your Settings\n\n\n\nClick on the Appearance window and choose Widget Visibility\n\n\n\nCustomize the Offline Status and Offline Message\n\n\n\nClick Save\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it! Your offline WhatsApp automatic reply will be sent to anyone trying to contact you outside of your working hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Automate WhatsApp marketing\n\n\n\nYou can show your customers your new deals or give them a discount code through an automated WhatsApp chatbot message. Here’s how to set it up using Tidio’s message flows:\n\n\n\n\nGo to Flows >> Strategies and choose the AI Responder template \n\n\n\nCustomize the Visitor Says trigger to recognize the client’s query\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the response to match your marketing goals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went with a discount code, but you can also show the customer your new releases, best-selling products, and more.\n\n\n\n3. Create WhatsApp automated response\n\n\n\nAuto-replies are mostly used for customer support-related questions and FAQs. So, let’s check how to send automated WhatsApp messages to answer these queries.\n\n\n\nFor this one, we’ll use the AI Responder chatbot flow template again.\n\n\n\n\nEdit the Visitor Says trigger with questions related to a specific user intent\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to answer questions about your shipping policy, write down example queries related to it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd remember that one chatbot = one intent. So, if you want to answer a question about your pricing as well, then you need to create another chatbot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize the response text\n\n\n\n\nAnswer the question as precisely as possible and ensure the text is in accordance with your brand voice. Let’s answer the shipping question as an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Check out how to integrate WhatsApp with Tidio and use bots on the app.\n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nWhat are the top WhatsApp automation software that you can use for your business?
