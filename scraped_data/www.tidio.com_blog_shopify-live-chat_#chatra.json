In-Depth Guide for Online Businesses\n\n\n\nThe Best 19 Free Live Chat Software for Websites\n\n\n\n5 Best Live Chat for Sales Teams [+Tips & Techniques]\n\n\n\n\nBut before we go through the in-depth reviews of the best live chat apps for Shopify—\n\n\n\nLet’s start with some definitions and background knowledge.\n\n\n\nWhat is Shopify live chat?\n\n\n\nShopify live chat is a feature that online store owners can integrate into their Shopify websites to provide real-time customer support and assistance. It enables immediate communication between the retailer and the customer, allowing for swift responses to questions, resolving issues, or offering product recommendations.\n\n\n\nHere’s what live chat for Shopify looks like on Forza10’s website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy embedding a live chat option on their website, Shopify merchants can increase sales, boost conversions, and build stronger client relationships.\n\n\n\nVarious third-party apps available in the Shopify App Store can be used to integrate this feature, each offering its own set of unique features and customization options tailored to the merchant’s needs.\n\n\n\nWhat is Shopify live chat used for?\n\n\n\nShopify customer service chat is primarily used to enhance the online shopping experience by providing instantaneous customer support. This helps businesses improve customer satisfaction while providing self-service to shoppers and decreasing the workload of your agents.\n\n\n\nCustomers often have queries or concerns when shopping online, whether it’s about product details, shipping, or ecommerce return policies. Instead of searching through the website or waiting for an email response, they can use the live chat feature to get immediate answers. This not only facilitates smoother transactions but also boosts customer confidence and trust in the brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, a study shows that over 89% of shoppers say a quick response impacts their choice of the brand they buy from. Moreover, as many as 81% of buyers will likely make a repeat purchase if a company offers a positive customer experience.\n\n\n\nRetailers can proactively engage visitors, offer personalized product recommendations, and address potential objections in real time. This is important as personalization is appealing to about 90% of customers and over 52% of buyers expect personalized offers from the brand.\n\n\n\nOn top of serving as a customer service tool, live chat provides valuable insights into customer behaviors and preferences, helping businesses refine their strategies or offerings.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn how Ad hoc Atelier used Tidio to boost conversion rates.\n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nIt’s time to reveal our top picks of Shopify live chat platforms your business will benefit from.\n\n\n\nWhat is the best live chat for a Shopify store?\n\n\n\nFrom hundreds of options, we’ve narrowed our list down to 10 of the best ones.

But, most other software from our list will work similarly when integrating it into your ecommerce site. Let’s go through a few easy steps you can use to add live chat to your online store. \n\n\n\nThe first and most important step is to install Tidio via Shopify plugin. To do this, log into your Shopify account, go to the Apps tab, and type “live chat” or a specific provider into the search bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, select the software and click on the Add app button. Select Install App on the following page. And that’s it—your live chat has been added to your ecommerce site. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now customize your widget and the system to your needs by following the steps in your chat’s admin panel. \n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use JavaScript to add the live chat to your Shopify store. \n\n\n\nRead more: Check out all the steps you need to take to install Tidio on Shopify.\n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nLet’s find out what are the key features when it comes to Shopify live chat support.\n\n\n\nWhat features to look out for in the Shopify live chat app?\n\n\n\nFirst of all, you should consider the following—\n\n\n\nWhat do you need the software to do? Do you want a helpdesk system, a tool to upsell products and increase your conversion rates, or an app to include on all of your sales channels? \n\n\n\nYour must-have features will depend on the functionality you need the Shopify chat box to perform. But the core features everyone should look out for are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo-code builder\n\n\n\n\nChances are you’re not a developer. So, in order to build the chat box, you’d have to hire a professional who can code it for you. But if you choose to get a chat for Shopify that offers a visual builder, you won’t have to worry about it. You and everyone in your existing team will be able to create and customize the chat box. \n\n\n\n\nCanned responses\n\n\n\n\nCanned responses are the pre-written replies answering frequently asked queries that the support agents can send to shoppers when a common question appears. This feature speeds up your customer service processes and improves the overall client experience. \n\n\n\n\nUseful integrations\n\n\n\n\nSome of the most popular ecommerce integrations include Zapier, Google Analytics, and popular CRM systems like HubSpot or Salesforce. And your company might need more specific connections with social media including Facebook and Instagram, or communication apps like WhatsApp. So, ensure the software you choose offers integrations with the platforms you’re currently using. \n\n\n\n\nLive view of website visitors\n\n\n\n\nThis feature allows you to view the people who are on your website, find out which pages they’re looking at, and spot the places they get stuck on. It’s useful for reaching out to visitors at the right time of their customer journey and pushing them down the sales funnel.\n\n\n\n\nAnalytics and reports\n\n\n\n\nTracking performance lets you improve the efforts in just the right areas. And reports are your best friend when it comes to a data-driven approach to your customer service. These reports clearly show how efficient your support team is, how satisfied the clients are, and much more. \n\n\n\nSo, these were the functionalities that you should look for when choosing a live chat for your Shopify store. But what about the things you should avoid?\n\n\n\nWhat to avoid in live chat apps for Shopify?\n\n\n\nWhen choosing your Shopify live chat app, you should ensure it doesn’t cause you more work than it helps you with. A lack of chat history can cause a mess in your Shopify inbox, whereas a clunky Facebook Messenger integration will detract your social media customers. But that’s not even the worst of it.\n\n\n\nSome of the things you should watch out for are:\n\n\n\n\nNo automations\n\n\n\n\nCustomer service automations, such as AI chatbots, speed up your workflows, decrease workload, and improve client satisfaction with your brand. Whenever your support agents aren’t available, the system will take care of the requests, collect information, and perform the most repetitive tasks. This way, the shopper gets their answers straight away and your reps don’t have so many tasks on hand.\n\n\n\n\nLack of multilingual options\n\n\n\n\nThe clients entering your page want to feel welcome and like they belong. But that won’t be the case if your customer service system doesn’t understand their requests because of the language barrier. So, you should ensure that the software you choose at least includes the most common languages of the world. \n\n\n\n\nSeparate modules you need to purchase\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great thing when it comes to customization of the system to your needs—not a good one for your wallet. You can pick and choose the tools and capabilities that your business requires from the Shopify live chat and pay for them without the extra unnecessaries. But, it can get very pricey when you have to pay for each capability on its own instead of getting one tool that does it all. \n\n\n\nLive chat for Shopify: summary\n\n\n\nAll in all, the Shopify customer service chat is a real-time support for your ecommerce store visitors that helps them find the right products and answers they seek. It also helps businesses by improving customer satisfaction and therefore boosting sales. \n\n\n\nAnd remember—when choosing a live chat plugin for Shopify, remember to look for a no-code builder, useful integrations, automations, and analytics with reporting dashboards.\n\n\n\nSome of the best Shopify chat apps to get for your ecommerce store, include:\n\n\n\n\nTidio\n\n\n\nLiveChat\n\n\n\nZendesk\n\n\n\nTawk.to\n\n\n\nChatra\n\n\n\nJivoChat\n\n\n\nGorgias\n\n\n\nDondy\n\n\n\nPure Chat\n\n\n\nRe:amaze\n\n\n\n\nInstall Shopify chat to your store today and start converting more of your visitors into customers.\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nHow to add live chat to a Shopify store?
