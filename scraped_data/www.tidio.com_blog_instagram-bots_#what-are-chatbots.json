You became curious about who the person responsible for the likes was. You visited their profile. There is a high probability that you liked some of their posts to return the favor.\n\n\n\nThat was exactly their end goal from the start—you fell for it hook, line, and sinker.\n\n\n\nAnd what’s more, they may not have been real people at all. They might have been Instagram bots!\n\n\n\nCare to learn more about them?\n\n\n\nIn this article:\n\n\n\n\nWhat an Instagram bot is and how it works\n\n\n\nWhy there are so many of them on social media\n\n\n\nExamples of Instagram bot platforms and tools\n\n\n\nHow to create your very own Instagram bot\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Automate replies to your stories and get more IG interactions from day one\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in chat-bots specifically, you can also read our separate guides:\n\n\n\n\nWhat Are Instagram Chatbots and How to Use Them?\n\n\n\nChatbots Explained: How Does a Chatbot Work? \n\n\n\nBest Chatbot Apps for Android and iOS\n\n\n\n\nWhat are bots on Instagram?\n\n\n\nInstagram bots are computer programs that automatically post content or send messages on behalf of users. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as increasing follower count, driving traffic to websites, or promoting products. Some bots are also designed to engage with other users, by liking and commenting on their Instagram posts.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, bots mean fake users or trolls. That’s why some Instagram bots, for example the ones spreading fake news and misinformation, are perceived as harmful.\n\n\n\nBut—\n\n\n\nThere are also good Instagram bots that can help you with marketing automation or sending automatic replies through Instagram direct messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, are Instagram bots allowed?\n\n\n\nBots as such are not prohibited, but some of the ways they are used violate Instagram’s policy on spam. You are not allowed to: post, share, engage with content or create accounts, Groups, Pages, Events or other assets, either manually or automatically, at very high frequencies.\n\n\n\nAs a general rule, you should also not use bots that involve creating fake accounts. In theory, you might get banned and lose all the popularity you have earned.\n\n\n\nWhy does Instagram have so many bots?\n\n\n\nAccording to some estimates, about 10% of Instagram accounts are bots. With about 1 billion user base this translates into 100 million fake IG accounts.\n\n\n\nThere are a few reasons why Instagram and other social media are infested with bots.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, bots can be used to boost engagement and increase visibility among real users. Many profiles are trying to outsmart the algorithms and make their posts and accounts more popular. With automated comments and likes, your content can gain some initial momentum.\n\n\n\nSecondly, Insta bots are relatively easy to create. There are many tools and platforms that you can use to build custom bots or manage your bot accounts. No advanced technical knowledge or coding skills are needed. Pretty much anyone can get their own Instagram bot or use a platform to buy “robot” followers.\n\n\n\nLast but not least, fake bot accounts on Instagram are difficult to eliminate. While using bots is, obviously, frowned upon, most social media still have problems with enforcing their policies regarding fake accounts. You can report profiles and Instagram won’t take them down unless they violate other serious policies.\n\n\n\nTo sum up, Instagram bots are:\n\n\n\n\nBelieved to be an effective technique to boost engagement\n\n\n\nEasy to set up and customize without specialist knowledge\n\n\n\nDifficult to get under control or delete by the platform itself\n\n\n\n\nThese three aspects contribute to their massive popularity.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of Instagram bots?\n\n\n\nSome Instagram bots are designed to get you more followers, while others can help you automate scheduling your Instagram posts in advance.\n\n\n\nHow do Instagram bots work exactly?\n\n\n\nThe most common type of Instagram bots is the one designed for promoting your profile. These bots usually work by following a bunch of people in your target niche and interacting with their posts. This helps to get your name out there and get more people interested in checking out your profile.\n\n\n\nInstagram bots can:\n\n\n\n\nFollow other influencers and users\n\n\n\nLike and comment on posts with specific hashtags\n\n\n\nView Instagram stories and send messages\n\n\n\nSend automatic replies in DM channels\n\n\n\nSchedule and publish your content for you\n\n\n\nSend notifications and manage your interactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the term bot is very broad and can mean a lot of different things. The matter is also complicated by the fact that some of the solutions deliberately refrain from calling themselves instagram bots.\n\n\n\nFor example, “social media marketing agencies” such as Social Sensei explicitly say that they don’t use bots or Instagram scripts.\n\n\n\nBut they accomplish the same thing and use similar strategies, even if there are real people operating behind the scenes. But for some reason, if you try to Google Instagram bots, you can expect those “agencies” to pop up more than once. A rose by any other name…\n\n\n\nThe burning question is—\n\n\n\nAre Instagram bots and automation services effective, or are they a scam?\n\n\n\nWell, you shouldn’t expect more than 1% of bot interactions resulting in getting a new follower. A recent experiment shows that about 1,200 story views, comments, and likes can bring you… 8 new Instagram followers. This means that the conversion rate was slightly below 0.7%, which isn’t particularly impressive.\n\n\n\nHowever, one metric that you can max out with automation is your customer satisfaction score (CSAT). Replying to messages with IG bots improves your average response speed and improves customer experience. \n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the Instagram automation software that you may want to check out.\n\n\n\nBest Instagram bots you can try in 2022\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of Instagram bot providers on the market. So, how do you know which one is the best for you? And, more importantly, how do you avoid getting scammed by a bot that doesn’t deliver on its promises?\n\n\n\nHere is a rundown of the top Instagram bots on the market, as well as their pros and cons.\n\n\n\nInstagram growth serviceWhat it is best forFree trialTrustPilot scoreTidioMessage automationYes2.9/5  ⭐Hyper IBFAutomatic followingNoN/AKickstaGetting upvotesNo3.5/5  ⭐InstamberDetailed niche targetingNo2.4/5  ⭐NitreoFollow and unfollow cyclesNo2.0/5  ⭐JarveeBoosting IG overall presenceYes4.1/5  ⭐InflactSelling via InstagramNo4.6/5  ⭐KenjiInstagram Story viewsNo1.9/5  ⭐Growth BeastAutomatic comments and viewsYesN/A\n\n\n\nLet’s go through the more in-depth descriptions of each platform to find the right choice for you.\n\n\n\n1.

You can choose one of Instagram bot services like the ones mentioned above. But you can also buy Instagram followers from sites like Fiverr. It is easy to find people who will follow you or who will like and comment on your photos if you pay for them.\n\n\n\nHowever, just because you can do it doesn’t really mean that you should do it.\n\n\n\nShould I use Instagram bots?\n\n\n\nNo, you should not. Unless by “bots” you mean some content management and Instagram automation tools. However, you should never buy fake followers on Instagram.\n\n\n\nInstagram’s algorithms can detect which interactions come from spammy bots and which from genuine Instagram followers.\n\n\n\nSource: Wild Eye\n\n\n\nSome new research suggests that Instagram bot followers have a negative impact on your profile’s performance. For example, one experiment shows that removing bots from Instagram (about 20% of all followers) had a positive impact on real engagement and reach. It translated into a 92% increase in the number of total post impressions.\n\n\n\nStill, you can use Instagram integrations that will help you send automatic replies and messages.\n\n\n\nHere is the right and legitimate way to connect Instagram and bots.\n\n\n\nHow to create an Instagram bot that doesn’t violate Instagram’s terms of service\n\n\n\nHere is how to make your own Insta bot with one of the best Instagram bot services.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Create your free Tidio account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the signup page. Provide your email or sign in with your Facebook account.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Complete the registration tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the instructions and set up your live chat widget. Don’t worry about it if you intend to use chatbots only on your Instagram account. However, it is a good idea to add a live chat widget on your website and connect it with Tidio.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Connect your Instagram account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Settings > Channels > Instagram and connect your Instagram Business account. If you are still using a personal profile, it is a great opportunity to upgrade your account. Just like Facebook Business pages and WhatsApp Business, Instagram Business is completely free.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Set up your chatbot triggers and actions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use a drag-n-drop visual editor to specify the sequence of messages that the bot will write. You can also add elements such as multimedia or buttons for better user experience. \n\n\n\nStep 5: Test your new Instagram bot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last thing left is to test your bot. Click the test button to see a preview of the conversation design. While it seems simple enough, designing your own bots is quite an interesting and intricate process.\n\n\n\nYou can check out more tutorials about creating bots here:\n\n\n\n\nHow to Make a Chatbot From Scratch [No Coding]\n\n\n\nChatbot Design: Best Practices & Insider Tips\n\n\n\nGood Chatbot Interface Examples to Inspire Your Own\n\n\n\n\nHow to promote my Instagram profile without using IG bots?\n\n\n\nMany of the popular methods for getting followers on autopilot, such as using bots, are against the platform’s terms of service. So, how can you boost your visibility without buying followers or resorting to other prohibited methods?\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking to promote your profile without bots, there are a few things you can do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you know what? Most of these methods will help you get better results, even if you still decide to use bots for automating some of your activities.\n\n\n\n1. Focus on creating high-quality content to boost organic growth\n\n\n\nIt sounds quite obvious, but there is really no way around it. If you want to be successful, interesting Instagram content is more important than whether you use a social media manager for post scheduling or not. Make sure that your videos and photos are visually appealing, and your posts are engaging.\n\n\n\n2. Use the right hashtags and analyze their popularity\n\n\n\nYou can use Instagram hashtags to make your content more discoverable, and connect with other users who share similar interests. Consider using third-party apps to monitor Instagram trends and increase your visibility and reach. For example, social listening tools such as Brand24 are very good at tracking hashtags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Take advantage of Instagram Stories, Live, and other features\n\n\n\nInstagram Stories are an incredibly effective way to connect with your audience and share your brand’s story. According to a report by Business Insider, 70% of Gen Z users watch Instagram Stories on a daily basis. They are perfect pieces of content for people with a short attention span.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike a long blog post or even a short video, Instagram Stories can be quickly viewed and digested. If you think about it, the whole TikTok platform is based on the same principle—and it is extremely popular.\n\n\n\n4. Interact with other users to build relationships and grow your following\n\n\n\nYes. It is exactly the sort of thing that you would want to automate with bots and scripts. But don’t. People hate spammy bots, and they can usually recognize them from miles away. If you are serious about building a connection with your audience, nothing beats real interactions.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nUsing social media automation tools and Instagram bots can help you save time and grow your social media accounts. They can automate tasks like posting, following, unfollowing, liking, and commenting. They can also help you find and connect with potential customers and followers who are interested in your products or services.\n\n\n\nThe best automation tools and bots for Instagram are:\n\n\n\n\nTidio\n\n\n\nHyper IBF\n\n\n\nKicksta\n\n\n\nInstamber\n\n\n\nNitreo\n\n\n\nJarvee\n\n\n\nInflact\n\n\n\nKenji\n\n\n\nGrowth Beast\n\n\n\n\nHowever, you should never use bots to generate fake likes or comments on your posts. It can lead to your account being banned by Instagram. Additionally, it also creates a negative impression of your brand, as people will know that you are using prohibited engagement tricks.\n\n\n\nThere is no easy way to grow your Instagram following without putting in the work. If you want to be successful, you need to create high-quality content and interact meaningfully with other users. Automation might help you save time, but it will not get you followers who are genuinely interested in your brand. You can learn more about your potential audience by starting direct conversations instead.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Create free chatbots to increase sales and improve customer service\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\nShare this article:Kazimierz RajnerowiczKazimierz was one of the original authors of Tidio Blog.
