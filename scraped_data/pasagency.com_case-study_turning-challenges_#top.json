Additionally, we delved into months of return reports and Voices of Customer reports to pinpoint specific areas where customers encountered difficulties. We had a productive one-hour brainstorming meeting with the owner to gain a comprehensive understanding of customer needs. This session allowed us to gather valuable insights and ensure we addressed all pertinent information about the product to meet customer expectations effectively.\nThe Results\n\n\n\nWe reduced the return rate in half from 20% to 9% (because customers had the information they needed from the content, so buying and returning dropped)\nThe conversion rate improved as the information available allowed the customer to make the right choice and find what they needed.\nGood reviews were an aftereffect, as satisfied customers who got the right product were only happy to leave positive reviews.\n\n\nRETURN DROPPED20% TO 9%\nConversion Rate3X \nREVIEWS IMPROVED FROM3.7 TO 4.2\nCONTACT US\n\n\nPhone\n\n(561)-464-5333\n\nWebsite\n\nwww.pasagency.com\n\nMail\n\ninfo@pasagency.com \n\nLocation\n\n20283 FL-7, Boca Raton, FL 33498\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Name *Last Name *Phone *Email *Your Seller Display Name* *Link to one of your products or brand store on Amazon*What’s the main reason for contact?What’s the main reason for contact?I`m Looking to update my creativesI`m concerned about my advertising perfomanceI`m looking for catlog managementI want to launch on AmazonI`m lookjing for a full-service managementMy current agency is to expensiveSEND  \n \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us OnLink to FacebookLink to LinkedInLink to Instagram\n\n\nStart your Project WITH US\nReady to start your Audit?\n\n\n\nSTART YOUR AUDIT\n\n\nLet’s Contact\n\n\n\n+1 (561) 464-533\ninfo@pasagency.com\n20283 FL-7, Boca Raton, FL 33498\n\n\n\nWhat We do\n\n\n\nFull Account Management\nSEO and Listing Optimization\nPPC Campaign Management\nCreatives and Graphic Design\n\n\n\n\nListing Reinstatement\nRefunds and Reimbursement \nGrowth Strategy and Consultation\n\n\n\nWho We Are\nAbout Us\nOur Team\n\n\n\nResources\nBlog\nCase Studies\n\n \t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n\n                        © 2024, Copyright PAS Agency\n\n                        Cookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\n\n                    \n\n\t            \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\nScroll to top"
