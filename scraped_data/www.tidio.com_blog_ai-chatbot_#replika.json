And for a good reason. OpenAI ChatGPT is an AI response generator that comes in two models: OpenAI GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. It’s a simple-to-use yet impressive software that can communicate with users, write different types of content, and provide ideas. \n\n\n\nOpenAI GPT-4 is trained on a very large dataset which makes it even more flexible and accurate when answering prompts. Once you start a conversation with the system, it will remember the topic and use the previous messages for context. You can also store chats on the left-hand side of the screen and jump between them or share a particularly interesting conversation with others.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nA variety of applications\n\n\n\nConversational tone\n\n\n\nLarge database of information\n\n\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\n\nFree version available\n\n\n\nChatGPT Plus ($20/mo)\n\n\n\nPaid plans sold per number of tokens\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn how to use ChatGPT for customer service and scale your business.\n\n\n\n2.

Gemini AI connects to the internet and finds sources for the information it provides to the users. In comparison to ChatGPT, Gemini’s users state it feels more conversational and less text-oriented.\n\n\n\nMoreover, this Google AI chatbot lets you edit prompts after sending them and provides three drafts for each output. This lets you pick the most suitable version for your needs. You can also export the fully formatted prompts to a Google Doc or as a Gmail draft for easier sharing. \n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\n“Google it” yourself button\n\n\n\nShows multiple drafts of an answer\n\n\n\nImage generation directly on the chat\n\n\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\n\nFree to use \n\n\n\n\n3.
