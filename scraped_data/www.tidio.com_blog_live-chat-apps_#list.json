It can increase customer satisfaction and reduce customer service costs.\n\n\n\nThe fact that you decided to offer live chat for your customers is a smart move.\n\n\n\nBut—\n\n\n\nWith so many good live chat apps to choose from, it can be hard to know which one is the best for your business.\n\n\n\nDon’t worry.\n\n\n\nWe will compare some of the most popular support chat solutions and help you decide which one is right for you.\n\n\n\nIn this article:\n\n\n\n\nA quick overview of the live chat market\n\n\n\nThe best providers of live chat apps for Android and iOS\n\n\n\nHow to add a support chat button on your page\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Start using the most feature-rich free live chat app on the market\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about Tidio Live Chat        \n            \n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in free live chat apps or plugins developed for specific platforms, you can also check:\n\n\n\n\nBest Free Live Chat Software [2023]\n\n\n\nBest WordPress Live Chat Plugins [2023]\n\n\n\nBest Shopify Live Chat Solutions [2023]\n\n\n\n\nLive chat apps: an overview\n\n\n\nThere are over 400 live chat software products available online. But several of the most popular options get the majority of users. Tawk.to, followed by Zendesk Chat, LiveChat, and Tidio are the leading live chat applications on the market.\n\n\n\nSource: enlyft.com\n\n\n\nLive chat apps are normally offered alongside other customer service tools, such as support chatbots. These solutions are provided by companies operating in the customer service management segment. \n\n\n\nUsers can customize their chat widgets, whether on the front end (visually), or the back end (rules, operating hours, and notifications). For example, Tidio comes with automated reminders to reduce shopping cart abandonment. The app uses special surveys that ensure customers’ email and phone numbers are collected.\n\n\n\nMany live chat apps are designed for omnichannel communication. Consumers are often active on several social media platforms (and they still use their good old emails too), so it makes sense to have a single tool to communicate through all mediums.\n\n\n\nBut why should live chat become your main channel of communication?\n\n\n\nLive chat services have the highest satisfaction rate (75%) of all customer service communication tools. By the end of 2022, an expected 85% of companies will offer some form of live chat support. This shows us that it’s the undisputed champion of online customer service.\n\n\n\nLive chat service has only grown more important over time, and it’s something your competition is already leveraging. So, let’s look at the chat platforms that enable you to leverage it as well!\n\n\n\nBest live chat app comparison\n\n\n\nLive chatFree planRating ⭐Tidio✅4.8/5 ⭐Zendesk Messaging✅4.3/5 ⭐HubSpot Chat✅4.5/5 ⭐Freshdesk Messaging✅4.3/5 ⭐Birdeye❌4.8/5 ⭐LiveChat❌4.5/5 ⭐MobileMonkey Chat❌4.9/5 ⭐\n\n\n\nChoosing the right live chat app for your business can be tricky. It’s important to take a look at the main features the app provides, the pricing, and the overall user experience to see which one is right for you.\n\n\n\nSome of the most important features to consider are how much customer support you need, how many chats you can handle at once, and whether you need features like chatbots or video calling.\n\n\n\nLet’s go through our list of the best live chat apps one by one.\n\n\n\n1.

This is quite convenient because you can synchronize your customer data across different modules offered by HubSpot. The live chat widget is larger and a bit more intrusive than some of the options we’ve looked at. However, it’s fairly responsive, which is great considering the “forever free” offer of HubSpot CRM. Overall, it’s Zendesk alternative.\n\n\n\nThe HubSpot live chat app displays relevant contact information and works with a few other channels. You can integrate it with Slack, which is especially helpful if you need to keep track of many follow-up messages. In terms of analytics, there are some useful automatic reporting tools. They allow users to review customer satisfaction ratings, number of conversations, conversation lengths, etc.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n\n\nMany features for improving conversion rates and setting up custom workflows\n\n\n\nSmall businesses can start with the “forever free” option and scale up later\n\n\n\nCalendar booking is highly responsive\n\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n\n\nThe webpage live chat window is large and intrusive (taking up more screen real estate than necessary and can be distracting to visitors)\n\n\n\nNotifications for new conversations are too subtle (most alternatives make it extremely clear when a new conversation is initiated)\n\n\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\n\nFree sales tools.

The webchat widget can be installed on any website and used to nurture leads.\n\n\n\nBirdeye’s live chat feature focuses on closing the sale, more than most alternative products do. Each new conversation opens with an agent’s name and phone number.
