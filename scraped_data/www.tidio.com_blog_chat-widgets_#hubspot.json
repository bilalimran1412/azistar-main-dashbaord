If you’re interested in live chat software and chatbots, check out these articles:\n\n\n\n\nUltimate Guide to Chatbots\n\n\n\nChatbots FAQ\n\n\n\nSimple Chatbot Guide for Beginners \n\n\n\nGenerate Leads with Live Chat and Chatbots\n\n\n\n\nFirst things first, though—\n\n\n\nLet’s establish what kind of widget we’re looking at and why you should even bother.\n\n\n\nWhat is a chat widget?\n\n\n\nA chat widget is a window on a website that enables interactions between a potential customer and the brand. It usually pops up as a button on the bottom of the page to welcome visitors and offer assistance.\n\n\n\nOnce the visitor clicks on the button, a live chat widget pops up, and the website visitor is all set to talk with a customer support agent or chatbot.\n\n\n\nWhy do you need a chat widget on your website?\n\n\n\nDid you know that the average attention span for an adult is about 8 seconds? That’s not very long to grab the interest of the potential customers to your website, is it? So you need to provide people with what they want fast, or they will leave your page. Chat widgets help with that. They answer your customer’s questions and can direct people to the pages with the right products there and then.\n\n\n\nWhy else live chat support with the use of a widget on your web pages is important:\n\n\n\n\nChat room widgets positively affect sales, and customers are happier to buy from companies that offer chat widgets. What’s more, you’re not limited to your website when using live chat software. You can put the chat widget on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and even Slack so your customers can find you on whichever platform they’re using.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Kayako\n\n\n\n\nA SuperOffice study has shown that an embedded chat widget is also a preferred communication method for customers. It comes before social media and phone calls which is important to note for ecommerce businesses looking to improve their customer relations.\n\n\n\n\nSource: SuperOffice\n\n\n\n\nOverall, chat widgets online are a great way to improve your company’s relationship with your customers. They can increase conversion rates and enhance customer experience. This is especially helpful for small businesses to boost their sales and grow faster.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Intercom\n\n\n\n\nOther than communication, you can use pop-up widgets for marketing automation. You can program your website chat window to collect emails by showing people newsletter signup forms or increase sales by routing the customer to your SALE items.\n\n\n\nYour embedded chat box can also collect data about your customer. This includes what they were doing on your website and any additional information they gave you, like a phone number or their email address. This can help you provide a more personalized experience for returning clients.\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Find out some of the essential chatbot statistics to grow your business effectively. \n\n\n\nMoving on to the greatest of the great—\n\n\n\nHere’s some basic info about each chat widget we tested.\n\n\n\nChat widgetG2 review scoreFree planFree trialTidio 4.6★✅✅Tawk.to4.6★✅✅LiveChat 4.5★❌✅LiveAgent4.5★✅✅HubSpot Live Chat 4.4★✅❌PureChat 4.4★❌✅Zoho desk4.4★✅✅Fresh desk4.4★✅✅Olark4.3★❌✅Zendesk4.2★❌✅\n\n\n\nLet’s jump straight into the detailed reviews of the 10 best chat widgets out there.\n\n\n\nTidio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re not here to listen to us bragging about how great we are and that we’re “the best chat widget for a website.” Check out some Tidio reviews and register for free to test our website chat widget yourself.\n\n\n\nLet’s keep it short and sweet then—\n\n\n\nTidio is a multi-channel support product with a shared inbox for your team.

And because of that, there isn’t enough evidence to accurately tell you the cons of this product.\n\n\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\n\nLive chat ($29/mo)\n\n\n\nPro (on request)\n\n\n\n\n(free chat widget for website 14-day trial available)\n\n\n\nRead more: Explore the best live chat script templates that will help you boost customer experience.\n\n\n\nZendesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chat widget allows you to send files and ask for customer reviews.

By far, the most negative reviews are about long response time from the support team and not enough knowledge about the product.\n\n\n\nDifficult to track through closed tickets.\n\n\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\n\nSuite Team ($49/mo)\n\n\n\nSuite Growth ($79/mo)\n\n\n\nSuite Professional ($99/mo)\n\n\n\nSuite Enterprise ($150/mo)\n\n\n\n\n(free chat widget for website 30-day trial available)\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover the top free live chat apps for your website\n\n\n\nFeatures to look out for\n\n\n\nMost of the chat solutions for the website listed above have a great number of features. But what’s important is choosing the website chat widget that provides the right features, not the biggest amount of them. \n\n\n\nDon’t be swayed by the quantity. Focus on the quality, and let’s go through the features you will need for your business to grow successfully.\n\n\n\nIntegrations\n\n\n\nIf you want to be able to keep your all of your client conversations in one place, no matter if their come from email, social media, or other messaging platform, you’ll need integrations. They basically state which systems you can connect to your widget seamlessly.\n\n\n\nThe most useful integrations include Facebook Messenger, MailChimp, Google Analytics, and Zapier. You can use the last two to keep an eye on your data and be able to integrate many other platforms to your online chat even without the native integration available.\n\n\n\nSearchable transcripts\n\n\n\nYou don’t want to have an unpleasant experience of seeing a negative review about your customer service and not knowing what happened. We don’t want that either.\n\n\n\nThat’s why you should look for the searchable transcript feature when you’re looking for your brand new, best online chat widget on the net. \n\n\n\nThis will allow you to search all your customers’ conversations on your website, look for issues and reoccurring complaints. With this tool, you’ll be able to fix the problems and improve your customers’ experience. \n\n\n\nHappy customers = Loyal customers. \n\n\n\nCustomer reviews\n\n\n\nYou want to tick all the essential boxes for your customer! \n\n\n\nThere is an option for your chat to send a customer review question straight after they finish a conversation. It’s a good idea to check if it’s available and use it!\n\n\n\nThis feature gets your customers’ ratings and reviews when the experience is still hot in their memory. This is the best time to check up on them and ask how it was, just like in a restaurant. A waitress asks how everything was when you just finished your food. It would be silly if they asked about your experience when you’re already back home. \n\n\n\nCustomizable design\n\n\n\nYour chat widget needs to fit in with your site. It needs to be the way you want it to be and do what you want it to do. \n\n\n\nThat’s why it’s important to check if the provider of your chat box has customization options for the design and functionality of your chat widget.\n\n\n\nMobile apps\n\n\n\nCheck if you can use your chat solution on your mobile devices. \n\n\n\nThis is important because you want to be there for your website visitors at all times.
