Its central feature is a live chat widget that ensures your customers get real-time support when browsing your website. \n\n\n\nTidio is now used by over 300,000 websites, many of which are Magento stores. It can operate on a large number of website-building platforms, including Magento, Shopify, and BigCommerce making it easier to set it up on your online store.

LiveChat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings: 4.5/5 ⭐️ (based on 730+ ratings)\n\n\n\nLiveChat is a helpdesk platform centered around its live chat service. This Magento live chat extension offers a ticketing system, canned responses, and a customizable chat widget. These chat features can help your support team improve customer communication and increase your conversion rates in the long run.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that LiveChat’s functionality is slightly different for Magento. Analytics, such as what customers are showing interest in, are provided directly through the chat tool itself. It focuses on using engaging greetings to get the attention of your store’s visitors. LiveChat provides customers the ability to rate their chat experience that lets you better understand your team’s performance and customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n\n\nLive chat widget that greets website visitors \n\n\n\nChat supervision allows for real-time monitoring of your team’s interactions with customers\n\n\n\nReports and analytics for a better understanding of your customers’ needs and expectations\n\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n\n\nSome reviewers report a lack of built-in advanced features\n\n\n\nSometimes there are technical difficulties with the mobile app\n\n\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\n\nStarter ($16/month/agent)\n\n\n\nTeam ($33/month/agent)\n\n\n\nBusiness ($50/month/agent)\n\n\n\nEnterprise→contact sales for a custom quote\n\n\n\n\nDid you know…\n\n\n\nAs many as 60% of customers are more likely to return to a website that offers live chat. On top of that, over 63% of shoppers are more likely to purchase from websites with a chat widget in comparison to those without one.\n\n\n\n3. Zendesk Messaging (Formerly Zendesk Chat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings: 4.3/5 ⭐️ (based on 4,320+ ratings)\n\n\n\nZendesk is a customer service platform that provides conversational support via the means of a live chat software and an array of other methods. Their services are touted as being either a service solution, or a sales solution, depending on which is more applicable to your store. Its backend is easy to use for your agents. It also offers an intuitive chat window for your website visitors to improve the customer experience on your site. \n\n\n\nZendesk Chat (now Zendesk Messaging) is the company’s live chat software that empowers your customer support team with better customer information to solve any shoppers’ concerns. It’s also very easy to use Zendesk Messaging with Magento. You just need to install Magento 2 Connector for Chat. \n\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n\n\nIncludes customer data migration from Magento for support team use\n\n\n\nMultichannel communication allows seamless conversations between customers and team members wherever they visit your store from\n\n\n\nPersonalization via the means of smart customer gathering allows for meaningful and interactive conversations\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\n\nIntegration with Magento requires a full Zendesk Suite plan\n\n\n\nSome customers complain of crashes when multiple chats are open\n\n\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\n\nSuite Team ($49/month/agent)\n\n\n\nSuite Growth ($79/month/agent)\n\n\n\nSuite Professional ($99/month/agent)\n\n\n\nSuite Enterprise ($150/month/agent)\n\n\n\n\n4.

It’s a simple and intuitive online chat system that includes role management, chat histories, query management, custom chat names, color schemes, and more.\n\n\n\nKeep this in mind that Webkul is, in some ways, more technical to use than its competitors. This is because it requires Node.js to be installed on your server in order to use their Chat System for Magento 2. \n\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n\n\nIncludes user login and registration options from the chat window\n\n\n\nDesigned specifically for Magento\n\n\n\nBuilt-in language translator available\n\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n\n\nLacks advanced analytics and ticketing\n\n\n\nComplicated installation process\n\n\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\n\nMagento Chat System ($99 one-time payment)\n\n\n\nMagento Enterprise Edition ($198 one-time payment)\n\n\n\nMagento Enterprise Cloud Edition ($198 one-time payment)\n\n\n\n\n5.

This is one of the more popular choices for live chat among online store owners. This is because of its reasonable pricing, many integrations, and features that the software comes with. LiveAgent users receive email piping, email templates, role permissions/settings, voice integration, and much more.\n\n\n\nThe positivity surrounding LiveAgent isn’t just based on its plethora of useful features, but its usability and UX as a whole.

Intercom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings: 4.4/5 ⭐️(based on 2,200+ ratings)\n\n\n\nIntercom is a great customer relationship management platform. However, it’s the only one on this list that doesn’t integrate with Magento directly. To go around this, you can simply use a 3rd party solution like Zapier to use Intercom as your Magento chat extension. \n\n\n\nSo, why go through the trouble?\n\n\n\nIntercom is a live chat tool meant for sales enablement and an increased number of checkouts. That means it’s built for the needs of busy sales teams at large businesses. It comes with lead qualification tools and full customization. It’s expensive and harder to set up for a Magento store than the other entries, but tens of thousands of customers are happy with their choice. \n\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n\n\nSales enablement tools to increase the number of checkouts\n\n\n\nLead qualification features\n\n\n\nShared inbox for your team for better organization of tasks\n\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n\n\nNo direct Magento integration\n\n\n\nRelatively high-cost\n\n\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\n\nContact sales for a personalized quote based on your businesses’ needs.\n\n\n\n\nHow to add Magento live chat to your Magento store?\n\n\n\nOf course, this may vary across live chat providers, but most will require you to follow a familiar process. As a good general example, let’s go over a step-by-step installation of Tidio to your Magento store.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Go to Tidio.com and set up a free account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Personalize your chat widget \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Go to Settings > Channels > LiveChat > Installation to find the installation code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Go to the Magento Admin page and select Content > Configuration > Design and choose the store you want to add Tidio live chat to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Go to Other Settings, expand the HTML Head section, and paste the chat code into the Scripts and Style Sheets box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Click Save and the chat widget will appear on your site\n\n\n\n\nAnd there you have it! You can start using your Magento live chat right away.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways: Magento live chat \n\n\n\nSetting up a Magento live chat solution is very simple. With very few exceptions, you simply need to go through one installation process and paste a code snippet to complete the integration. The key is to pick the best chat extension for your Magento store.\n\n\n\nSo, as a recap, the top live chat for Magento stores include:\n\n\n\n\nTidio\n\n\n\nLiveChat\n\n\n\nZendesk Messaging\n\n\n\nLive Chat by Webkul\n\n\n\nOlark \n\n\n\nSmartsupp Chat\n\n\n\nLiveHelp\n\n\n\nGorgias\n\n\n\nLiveAgent\n\n\n\nIntercom\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend Tidio because it checks off all the boxes you need for a Magento live chat service:\n\n\n\n\nEasy integration with Magento\n\n\n\nReasonable price\n\n\n\nWide selection of easy-to-use features\n\n\n\nAnalytics that let you know how your agents are performing\n\n\n\n\nJust remember to check if the live chat software that you’re choosing has all the features that your business needs.
