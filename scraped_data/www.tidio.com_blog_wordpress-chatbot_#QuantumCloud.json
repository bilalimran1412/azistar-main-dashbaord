This will help you stay organized and measure the results of your bot down the line.\n\n\n\nStep 2: List question-answer pairs\n\n\n\nCreate a list of all of the commonly asked questions and write down short answers to each one of them. You can also create an FAQ page for your website while you’re at it to give one more self-service option for your shoppers. \n\n\n\nThe answers should be concise and questions should be written in a natural language. For example:\n\n\n\nQ: How do I reset my password? A: You can reset your password by going to your account settings and clicking “Reset Password.” Follow the prompts to create a new password.\n\n\n\nAnd remember—the more Q&A pairs, the better customer service automation for your business.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Add chatbot plugin to WordPress site\n\n\n\nFind the Tidio WordPress plugin. You can do this by simply typing Tidio in the Plugins menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, log in to the platform and customize your widget. Once you’re happy with the look of your WP chatbot, customize the messages your chat flows will send or go to the Lyro tab and upload your question-answer pairs. \n\n\n\nYou can use chat flows or a conversational AI, Lyro, for your customer communication. Chat flows are rule-based chatbots that act based on predefined scenarios and use buttons for interactions with users. On the other hand, Lyro is an AI chatbot that works based on natural language processing and chats with users in a conversational way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover how to install Tidio on WordPress in more detail.

This way, you’ll be able to catch any imperfections before your clients use the system.\n\n\n\nOkay—let’s now look at how to choose the right platform for your site.\n\n\n\nHow to choose the right WordPress chatbot for your business?\n\n\n\nMany companies have unique requirements, so it’s crucial to ensure the software you’re considering aligns with your particular needs. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what to look for, depending on your business size.\n\n\n\nNano-business or freelancer\n\n\n\nIf you’re new in business or a freelancer, you’re likely seeking an affordable, or even free, WordPress chat assistant platform that provides basic features. Since you might not receive an overwhelming number of inquiries, a heavy-duty enterprise system isn’t necessary. Instead, opt for software with tools for organizing tickets, checking customer details, and tracking clients on the go via an app. A platform like Join.Chat or ArtiBot could be a good fit.\n\n\n\nSmall to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) \n\n\n\nFor SMBs managing a growing number of inquiries, software with automation, a common inbox, tracking capacity, and analytical dashboards might be beneficial. You should consider a platform such as Tidio, which combines a ticketing system, AI chatbots, and email marketing software.\n\n\n\nLarge or enterprise-level businesses \n\n\n\nBig businesses can benefit from a customized solution, aided by a dedicated success manager to ensure the AI chatbot for WordPress efficiently integrates with the entire system. Aim for a provider supplying scalable tools to elevate your support team’s productivity and automate monotonous tasks. A business of this size should lean toward a platform like HubSpot, known for its advanced features and functionality.\n\n\n\nWordPress chatbot: key takeaway\n\n\n\nAnd that’s a wrap! \n\n\n\nBut, before you leave, let’s quickly go through the main highlights.\n\n\n\nWordPress chatbot helps businesses achieve their business goals, improve customer service, boost the shopping experience, and increase sales.\n\n\n\nThe top plugins are:\n\n\n\n\nTidio \n\n\n\nHubSpot\n\n\n\nJoin.chat\n\n\n\nChatbot for WordPress\n\n\n\nCollect.chat\n\n\n\nIBM Watson\n\n\n\nChatra\n\n\n\nArtiBot\n\n\n\nZendesk\n\n\n\nWP-Chatbot for Messenger \n\n\n\n\nYou can also use ChatGPT for WordPress.
