Lyro uses best practices for data handling and retention, ensuring that your data is safe at all times.“We needed the most sustainable and efficient way to manage the traffic and improve customer satisfaction. So we implemented Tidio Flows technology.”Görkem ÖğütCEO & Founding Partner of Endeksa“We were searching for something that would give us the possibility to use automations as well as human interactions — and Tidio was the best solution for that.”Lorenzo ColucciCo-founder and CMO @ Ad Hoc Atelier“My main goal was to find an easy-to-teach app that comprehended all the tasks needed for our customer service. Tidio, from the beginning, was the perfect one.”Gabriele ScarcellaEcommerce Manager at Procosmet ItalyFrequently asked questionsCommon questions about Lyro, the AI chatbotHow is Lyro more powerful than Tidio’s Flows?FlowsExclusive to Tidio usersAre triggered by specific actions and can engage users proactivelyFollow user-defined rules and scripts to answer customer questionsPerfect for answering simple, pre-defined questions.LyroAvailable on Tidio.

Lyro can answer complex questions in a human-like manner based on your support content.\n \nKeep in mind that you don’t have to choose between Lyro and Flows. You can use both solutions at the same time to provide exceptional service to your customers.Are you using ChatGPT to power Lyro?No, we are not.  We use Claude (Anthropic AI) and our in-house models to power Lyro. We use Claude because this Large Language Model (LLM) has been developed with the goal of becoming helpful, honest, and harmless - making it the most trustworthy LLM on the market.Why shouldn’t I simply use ChatGPT for customer service?ChatGPTRole - Designed for general conversation, small tasks and entertainmentHow it works - Interprets massive sets of data it has learned during its training processEfficiency - Generally efficient for broad conversations, but may produce low-quality or wrong answers when asked for detailsLyroRole -Designed to provide customer service and supportHow it works - Interprets only your data to generate its responsesEfficiency - Provides detailed responses based exclusively on your support content, minimizing the probability of wrong answersIs Lyro free?No. Every Tidio account starts with 50 Lyro conversations for free, and all users can access better limits with our paid Lyro plan.Is Lyro available for all Tidio users?Lyro is not available to businesses operating in certain industries, such as medical & healthcare, gambling, investing, weapons & ammunition, and several others.What is a Lyro conversation?A Lyro conversation is a customer interaction that has at least one reply from our AI chatbot.\n \nEven if Lyro replies a dozen times or more to solve the customer’s problem, or if the customer leaves the website and returns to the chat at a later time, that still counts as a single conversation.When will my Lyro conversation limit refresh?Every Tidio account starts with 50 Lyro conversations, but the limit does not refresh for free. You can access higher Lyro conversation limits with our Lyro plan.\n \nIf you’re using the Lyro plan, your limit refreshes 30 days from the moment you made the payment.How much does Lyro cost?Your first 50 Lyro conversations are free. You can access more conversations with the Lyro plan:50 conversations - $39100 conversations - $75150 conversations - $110200 conversations - $140Can I use more than 200 Lyro conversations per month?Yes.

We know that switching from one customer service system to another can be difficult and we wanted to make it easy for you to use AI for support.\n \nThat’s why we upgraded Lyro - our AI chatbot - so you can add it as an extension to your existing customer service software.\n \nThis way, you can use Lyro to provide AI assistance without having to go through the hassle of changing platforms.How much does Lyro Connect cost?Lyro Connect is available only with a personalized Tidio+ subscription. A Lyro conversation starts from $0.5. Our sales representative will explain the pricing structure during your demo call.How does Lyro Connect work?Lyro Connect enables you to access Lyro without changing your support platform. Here’s how it works:Integrate Lyro with your existing support solution through Lyro ConnectShare your support content with Lyro and activate itLyro uses your support content to formulate its answers and provide personalized assistance to multiple customers at onceIf a customer asks a question that’s outside Lyro’s knowledge, the AI chatbot creates a ticket in your support solution so a real agent can answerIs Lyro secure for my data?Yes. We use Claude (Anthropic AI) to power Lyro. Claude is the most secure LLM on the market right now. It uses best practices for data handling and retention.How can Lyro answer customer questions without any training and with one-click activation?Lyro automatically scrapes your support content and uses it as its knowledge base. If the required information is part of your support content, Lyro will answer the customer’s question. If the answer is not part of your support content, Lyro will automatically forward the question to a human agent.What are the benefits of Lyro?Increase customer satisfaction: Tidio’s Lyro analyzes customer questions and delivers human-like answers in seconds. This enables your customers to receive the information they need 24/7, increasing their satisfaction.Increase your support team’s efficiency: Lyro detects and answers questions about order status, shipping policies, product availability, and more, within seconds. This frees up your operators to focus on complex or profitable issues so you can make your business more profitable.Scalable solution: Lyro learns new answers as your business grows and your needs change. The AI chatbot learns new information as you expand your knowledge base, so it can create new automated workflows as opportunities arise.Is Lyro effective?Yes, it is - our support team automated 58% of customer questions using it, and we have a complex product. Some users have even better results, automating 70% of inquiries.\n \nAnd its machine-learning algorithm makes it more effective over time. Lyro measures the helpfulness of its answers after customer interactions. Then, Lyro uses the data to adapt to incoming questions.\n \nYou can also help Lyro get even more accurate over time by assessing its performance and providing it with more FAQ content to fill in its blind spots. This enables Lyro to answer more questions, reducing your customers’ waiting time even further.Do you offer any other AI features?Tidio offers multiple AI features besides Lyro.
