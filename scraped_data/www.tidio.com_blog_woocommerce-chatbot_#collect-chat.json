Let‚Äôs examine each solution one by one.¬†\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs worth getting acquainted with all of them to decide which set of features would be most suitable for your online store.\n\n\n\n1. Tidio Chatbots for WooCommerce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper: Tidio\n\n\n\nRating: ‚≠ê 4.8 out of 5 stars (313 reviews)\n\n\n\nWith over 100,000+ active installations, Tidio is the most popular no-code chatbot solution for WooCommerce and WordPress stores. It has its own live chat widget that you can add to your website and advanced chatbot design features.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nOne-click installation for WordPress and WooCommerce stores\n\n\n\nOut-of-the-box solution with no additional configuration and bot training needed\n\n\n\nEcommerce chatbot templates for common customer service scenarios\n\n\n\nEcommerce chatbot templates for common customer service scenarios\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence and NLP message recognition engine\n\n\n\nDesigning custom conversation flows with a visual bot editor\n\n\n\nDiscount, lead generation, and abandoned cart workflows\n\n\n\nIntegrated CRM features and customer database management\n\n\n\nOmnichannel chatbots for your website, Instagram, and Messenger\n\n\n\nMessenger bot for Woocommerce without coding or using Dialogflow\n\n\n\nUnlimited configuration options through its JavaScript API or Zapier\n\n\n\nHelpful customer support, many online resources, and tutorials\n\n\n\n\nTidio is one of the best chatbot options for WooCommerce and you can use it to make chatbots from scratch in a matter of minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\n\nFree version available\n\n\n\nStarter ($29/mo)\n\n\n\nFlows ($29/mo)\n\n\n\nLyro AI ($39/mo)\n\n\n\nGrowth ($59/mo)\n\n\n\nTidio+ (starts at $749/mo)\n\n\n\n\nYou can integrate chatbots and your WooCommerce website.

WoowBot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper: QuantumCloud\n\n\n\nRating: ‚≠ê 4.8 out of 5 stars (16 reviews)\n\n\n\nThis WooCommerce chatbot solution is much less popular. Only 800+ users look pretty suspicious. But there is no need to worry. In fact, WoowBot is the good old WPbot and their combined numbers of installations are much higher. WoowBot just comes in a new ‚Äúpackaging‚Äù geared towards WooCommerce users. And there is nothing wrong with good packaging design.¬†\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nConversational product search engine\n\n\n\nAbandoned cart recovery and exit intent triggers\n\n\n\nIntegrated with Google‚Äôs natural language processing services (NLP)\n\n\n\nPopups for informing about special offers and featured products\n\n\n\nFacebook Messenger and WhatsApp integration available\n\n\n\nCustomizable chat icon and CSS\n\n\n\n\nWoowBot is a great choice for ecommerce stores that want to automate their customer support. It‚Äôs worth noticing that about 40% of businesses that use bots employ less than 10 people (in the whole company). Solutions such as WoowBot are designed to take over some of your repetitive tasks and questions about products. This allows your understaffed business to use the saved time for solving more complex issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing plans:\n\n\n\n\nFree. One chatbot template.\n\n\n\nPaid. ¬†A yearly WoowBot Pro license starts from $33.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Did you know?    Almost 41% of all online stores in 2021 were powered by WooCommerce. You can see how this platform compares to other ecommerce solutions in our guides: WooCommerce vs Magento and WooCommerce vs Shopify.\n\n\n\n\n3. Collect.chat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper: Collect.chat\n\n\n\nRating: ‚≠ê 4.4 out of 5 stars (28 reviews)\n\n\n\nJust as the name suggests, Collect.chat offers plenty of features related to lead generation. If you want to collect your customers‚Äô contact details and phone numbers through a chat window‚Äîrather than a popup‚Äîit is a viable option. This WooCommerce chatbot also offers many conversation templates for getting more insights about user experiences and collecting customer feedback.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nLead generation templates and custom surveys for collecting feedback\n\n\n\nAppointment booking through chatbot conversations\n\n\n\nReal-time notifications through email and other channels\n\n\n\nIntegration with Google Sheets, Hubspot, FreshDesk, and other CRM tools\n\n\n\nSMS verification for collected phone numbers\n\n\n\n\nCollect.chat is a popular live chat and chatbot solution, not only for WooCommerce stores. For instance, while it doesn‚Äôt make the cut as one of the best Shopify live chat apps, it does offer a Shopify integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing plans:\n\n\n\n\nFree. Limited to 50 chatbot responses.\n\n\n\nPaid. Different tiers with premium features and more automatic responses starting from $24/mo. Unlimited chatbot responses for $299 per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n    The importance of customer feedback    Getting insights from your visitors, users, and customers is essential for improving your products and processes. Collecting feedback with Tidio is easy and you can learn more about it from examples of chatbot use cases.\n\n\n\n\n4. Drift\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper: Drift\n\n\n\nRating: ‚≠ê 4.1 out of 5 stars (10 reviews)\n\n\n\nThis is another chatbot for WooCommerce that may get some people raising their eyebrows. This plugin hasn‚Äôt been tested with the latest 3 major releases of WordPress. And there aren‚Äôt too many positive reviews. Sounds shady, right? To be fair, Drift is a very advanced tool and their WordPress plugin page probably does not receive enough love and attention. However, it is among the best free live chat software in general, and not just for stores powered by WordPress.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nSlack integration with real-time notifications\n\n\n\nVirtual Selling Assistants that use patented AI\n\n\n\nLead-qualification tools and booking meetings with customers\n\n\n\nA/B testing and marketing conversion tracking\n\n\n\n\nDrift describe themselves as a marketing and sales acceleration platform. Their software offers much more than just chatbots but the price tag is also slightly more prohibitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing plans:\n\n\n\n\nFree. No custom chatbots‚Äîonly live chat.\n\n\n\nPaid. Prices are determined individually after reaching out to representatives. To create custom bots you can expect to pay a triple-digit sum each month.\n\n\n\n\n5. ChatBot for WooCommerce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper: ChatBot\n\n\n\nRating: ‚≠ê 4.6 out of 5 stars (15 reviews)\n\n\n\nChatBot is one of the LiveChat modules. It is sold separately and offers many advanced features. Just like in Drift, these tools create a complex ecosystem that automates all of your marketing activities.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nVisual chatbot flowchart builder¬†\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence and NLP engine\n\n\n\nAPI, webhooks, and Zapier integrations\n\n\n\nSeamless integrations with Messenger and Slack\n\n\n\nRich messages including buttons and media\n\n\n\nWidget customization options\n\n\n\n\nWooCommerce ChatBot is not an all-in-one app. It is a professional solution for experts. We recommend it to medium and large stores that know exactly what they want and are willing to pay for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing plans:\n\n\n\n\nNo freemium plan. But you can test this solution for 14 days without the need to unsubscribe.\n\n\n\nPaid. The Starter plan with 1 active chatbot, 1000 chatbot responses, and limited AI training options history costs $50 per month.\n\n\n\n\n6. Woo Bot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper: WP1\n\n\n\nExtension Requirements: Minimum PHP version: 5.6\n\n\n\nRating: N/A\n\n\n\nThis WooCommerce chatbot is slightly different from the others. It is a native WooCommerce extension developed by WP1, while the other solutions in this article are WordPress plugins. Woo Bot offers good integration with WooCommerce product inventory, so it is quite useful for product searches. However, there aren‚Äôt too many additional features.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nProduct search options via the chat window\n\n\n\nAutomatic responses available in your WooCommerce back-end panel\n\n\n\nChat icon and popup behavior configuration¬†\n\n\n\n\nIf you need a very simple bot for WooCommerce, this solution may work for you just fine.\n\n\n\nPricing plans:\n\n\n\n\nFree. Not available.\n\n\n\nPaid. $29 per year.\n\n\n\n\n7. IBM Watson Assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper: IBM & Cognitive Class AI\n\n\n\nRating: ‚≠ê 4.6 out of 5 stars (24 reviews)\n\n\n\nThis WooCommerce chatbot combines two technologies: IBM‚Äôs cloud-based conversational AI and a pre-configured chatbot in the form of a simple chat widget. In other words, you get state-of-the-art technology offered in an easy-to-use format.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nVoIP is available through a simple Twilio integration\n\n\n\nCustomizable chat window and chat icon\n\n\n\nResources on building your AI bot\n\n\n\n\nTo use this solution you need to create a separate IBM Cloud account and connect it with the widget. IBM Cloud services are free but there are some limits. You may want to upgrade to a higher tier if you want to process many queries from customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing plans:\n\n\n\n\nFree. 10,000 API calls (such as messages) per month.\n\n\n\nPaid. The Plus plan will cost you about $140 per 1,000 active users per month.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n    AI chatbots    The global conversation AI market is expected to grow to almost $20 billion by 2026. There are many ways of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in chatbots. You can find out more about them in our guide about the best AI chatbots.\n\n\n\n\n8. Xatkit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper: Xatkit\n\n\n\nRating: ‚≠ê 5 out of 5 stars (2 reviews)\n\n\n\nXatkit is a nice and simple add-on for creating interactive FAQs for online shoppers. And answering questions through a bot gives your users a much better customer experience than contacting a traditional customer support team (or scrolling through pages of a lengthy FAQ). You can also expand its functionality to connect the bot logic with your inventory.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nCustom bot icon and position\n\n\n\nOrder status and cart saver\n\n\n\nFeatured products and product search\n\n\n\n\nThis WooCommerce chatbot is quite similar to WoowBot and you can use it as a good alternative, especially if you are interested in features related to searching products.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing plans:\n\n\n\n\nFree. No freemium version but there is a free trial available for a month.\n\n\n\nPaid. Q&A plan for building basic FAQs starts from $19/month.\n\n\n\n\n9. ConversioBot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper: ConversioBot\n\n\n\nRating: ‚≠ê N/A\n\n\n\nThis WooCommerce chatbot is not available in the official WordPress plugin repository. However, it is still easy to install and add to any page on your website. This solution is more rudimentary than the majority of platforms or plugins described above. But it is quite popular nonetheless.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nAdd to cart and exit intent discounts\n\n\n\nIntegrates with Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel\n\n\n\nMultipage option with a single license\n\n\n\nNo monthly payments\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not interested in subscription-based solutions, ConversioBot can be a nice training ground. Paying for something one time sounds nice, doesn‚Äôt it? On the other hand, there are many free chat widgets that offer bot-related features.\n\n\n\nPricing plans:\n\n\n\n\nFree. Not available.\n\n\n\nPaid. One-time $38 fee to use it without limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Pro-Tip:    Bots can increase customer engagement among online shoppers and save abandoned carts. But increasing your conversion rates is just part of making your business thrive. Check out what are some of the essential customer success metrics.\n\n\n\n\n10. WooSmartBot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper: Jawad Ilyas\n\n\n\nRating: ‚≠ê N/A\n\n\n\nWooSmartBot offers just the bare essentials and is meant to be used as an alternative to your store‚Äôs search engine. Digital shoppers and users find bots more engaging because of the novelty effect of this technology. This WooCommerce chatbot talks with shoppers and sends them links to product pages that match their queries. It doesn‚Äôt get much simpler than that.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nCustom bot behavior for selected pages\n\n\n\nUnlimited conversations\n\n\n\nEditable welcome messages\n\n\n\nOne template\n\n\n\nProduct search\n\n\n\n\nPricing plans:\n\n\n\n\nFree. It is a new project without any premium features and too many users. But you can probably get in touch with its developers to give them some feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n        Chatbots are not the only apps used by online stores. If you are interested in other useful tools for increasing sales, here are some more WooCommerce plugins compared.\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nA good WooCommerce chatbot should be easy to install and offer features related to searching products and customer support. A perfect bot would send relevant messages, product recommendations, and understand your shoppers‚Äô questions.\n\n\n\nThe most popular and useful chatbot WooCommerce plugins are:\n\n\n\n\nTidio\n\n\n\nWoowBot\n\n\n\nCollect.chat\n\n\n\nDrift\n\n\n\nChatBot\n\n\n\nWoo Bot (by WP1)\n\n\n\nIBM Watson Assistant\n\n\n\nXatkit\n\n\n\nConversioBot\n\n\n\nWooSmartBot\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to install the best-rated and most popular option right away, just click below.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Install your own WooBot in minutes\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\nShare this article:Kazimierz RajnerowiczKazimierz was one of the original authors of Tidio Blog.
