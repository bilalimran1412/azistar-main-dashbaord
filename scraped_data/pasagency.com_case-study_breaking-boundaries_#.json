This situation made traditional reverse engineering and competitive search volume analysis unfeasible. Additionally, the brand faced the issue of a stalemate in revenue growth, necessitating a fresh approach to market expansion and customer engagement.\nTo address these challenges, our team utilized Amazon’s internal datasets, including search query performance reports, alongside external tools such as Helium 10 and Data Rova. This approach allowed us to focus on hyper-relevant, intent-based keywords for targeting potential new customers.\nOur Amazon PPC strategy maximizes visibility, drives sales, and protects our brand’s integrity. We focus on three main campaign types: Ranking Keyword Targeting Campaigns to target high-conversion keywords, Sales Boost Campaigns for peak buying times, and Defensive Campaigns to safeguard our brand against competitive bidding. Additionally, we employ various advertising strategies such as  Brand Tailored Promotions, Video in Search Ads, and Storefront Ads. To ensure sustained success, we follow a structured maintenance strategy involving regular reviews and adjustments based on performance data, aiming to minimize wasted ad spend, improve conversion rates, and manage bids effectively.\n\nCAMPAIGN TYPES\n\nRanking Keyword Targeting Campaigns: Targeting keywords with high conversion potential based on performance metrics.\nSales Boost Campaigns: Increasing visibility and sales during peak times.\nDefensive Campaigns: Protecting the brand against competitive bidding on branded terms.\n\n\nADDITIONAL STRATEGIES\n\nBrand Tailored Promotions: Custom promotions aligned with brand identity.\nVideo in Search Ads: Using video content in search results for higher engagement.\nStorefront Ads: Utilizing Amazon’s storefront as an ad space.\nRemarketing Initiatives: Targeting previous customers for repeat purchases and re-engaging customers who viewed but didn’t purchase.\n\n\nMAINTENANCE GUIDE\n\nWasted Ad Spend Reduction: Regularly reviewing search term reports and adding non-converting terms as negative keywords.\nConversion Rate Optimization (CVR): Adjusting bids and placements based on CVR performance.\nKeyword Graduation: Gradually scaling campaigns based on performance and relevance.\nProper Bid Management: Continuously optimizing bids based on performance and objectives.\nSearch Term Report Analysis: Leveraging data to identify trends and refine targeting strategies.\nProper Placement Management: Evaluating and adjusting ad placements for better performance.\n\nImplementing these strategies and maintenance practices ensures that Amazon PPC campaigns are well-managed, cost-efficient, and aligned with broader business goals. Regular monitoring and adjustments are essential for success in e-commerce advertising.\nTHE RESULTS\n\n \n92% UTILIZATION OF DEDICATED SKU  INVENTORY\n309% INCREASE IN YOY PRIME DAY RESULTS\nGENERATED $542K IN 60 HOURSImplementing these strategic campaigns led to a remarkable increase in revenue from $5.5M to $8.6M.
