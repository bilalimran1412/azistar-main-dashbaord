And which software should you choose? Is there a perfect chatbot solution tailored for the real estate market?\n\n\n\nWell—\n\n\n\nLet’s tackle all of these questions one by one.\n\n\n\nIn this article:\n\n\n\n\nWhat a real estate chatbot is\n\n\n\nChatbot usage in real estate\n\n\n\nBest platforms that you can try out\n\n\n\nHow to add a real estate chatbot template\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Screen rental prospects, collect leads, and answer property queries with bots\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn how other businesses use chatbots, here are some more articles that may interest you:\n\n\n\n\nBest Chatbot Examples Used by Well-Known Companies\n\n\n\nTop Real-Life Chatbot Use Cases That Work\n\n\n\nHow Online Stores Use Ecommerce Chatbots\n\n\n\n\nOK. First things first—\n\n\n\nWhat is a real estate chatbot?\n\n\n\nA  real estate chatbot is a virtual assistant that can handle inquiries about buying, selling, and renting homes. A real estate bot can answer questions about the process and provide updates on what’s happening with a sale or purchase. It can also schedule meetings, or collect contact details of online leads.\n\n\n\nIn the most general terms, chatbots can simulate conversations and send messages to your clients. A bot can use artificial intelligence or pre-defined conversation scripts.\n\n\n\nChatbots have been gaining popularity in recent years as a way to automate repetitive tasks. For instance, instead of typing out the same message for the hundredth time, you can set up a chatbot to send automatic replies for you.\n\n\n\nFor example, here is Alan—a real estate chatbot that assists human agents and helps customers with their queries related to home loans:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a chatbot as part of your real estate business can make buying or selling a home a much smoother process.\n\n\n\nHow chatbots can be used in the real estate business\n\n\n\nChatbots are commonly used in customer service to provide automated responses to customer questions. In real estate, this can mean answering questions about properties or the sales process.\n\n\n\nThe adoption rate of chatbots in this sector, however, is surprisingly low. For example, in Brazil, only 1% of chatbots were developed for real estate businesses. And only 8% of customers in Italy wanted to use virtual assistants for handling their real estate queries. \n\n\n\nChatbots in the finance and banking sector have received an equally mixed reception among customers. In spite of this, their usage is expected to increase tenfold between 2020 and 2030 at a 25.7% compound annual growth rate.\n\n\n\nAs with any new technology, consumers are still getting used to conversational bots. And the road to full adoption is bumpier in some industries than others. However, it’s hard to underestimate the advantages and benefits of chatbots. Instead of a potential risk, it’s better to see them as an opportunity, as in many cases chatbots can have an impressive ROI of over 1000%.\n\n\n\nReal estate chatbots can: \n\n\n\n\nCollect contact information and route prospective buyers to real estate agents\n\n\n\nBook appointments and property tours, manage your meeting calendar \n\n\n\nHelp customers with their search for a new home by providing them with listings that match their criteria\n\n\n\nGet rental applications from clients and qualify leads based on the data they submit\n\n\n\nProvide potential buyers with information about the property, such as square footage, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price, and location\n\n\n\nAnswer frequently asked questions regarding the technicalities related to buying or selling properties\n\n\n\n\nIn general, real estate businesses use bots to streamline the home-buying process. By automating repetitive tasks, such as sending messages and scheduling appointments, they can save time and money. Additionally, chatbots can help your real estate agents keep track of potential leads and customers. FAQ or property management chatbots have the potential to revolutionize your business.\n\n\n\nBest chatbots for real estate\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of chatbot apps to choose from. But which one is the best for real estate? You should focus on providers that offer services like lead capture, real-time updates, and automatic listing distribution. And of course, you’ll want to consider the costs of each platform.\n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nIs there any chatbot for the real estate industry that is better than the rest?\n\n\n\nTo help you make a decision, here is a comparison table of the most popular options:\n\n\n\nCompanyFree planRatingTidio✅4.7/5 ⭐ (1,155+ reviews)MobileMonkey❌4.9/5 ⭐ (275+ reviews)ChatBot❌4.5/5 ⭐ (15+ reviews)Tars❌4.7/5 ⭐ (145+ reviews)Collect.chat✅4.7/5 ⭐ (10+ reviews)Engati❌4.5/5 ⭐ (15+ reviews)Landbot✅4.7/5 ⭐ (220+ reviews)ManyChat✅4.6/5 ⭐ (130+ reviews)ReadyChat❌N/A\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the real estate bots and compare them in more detail.\n\n\n\n1.
