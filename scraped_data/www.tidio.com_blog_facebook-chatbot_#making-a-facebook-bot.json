A recent survey by Oracle confirms that about 80% of brands plan to use them in the near future. On top of that, a Nielsen study revealed that around 69% of customers believe that messaging apps have made their lives easier. \n\n\n\nBusinesses use Facebook Messenger chatbots to:\n\n\n\n\nDeliver conversational user experience\n\n\n\nIncrease customer engagement on pages\n\n\n\nAnswer common questions\n\n\n\nGenerate leads\n\n\n\nCreate automated customer care workflows\n\n\n\nReduce the workload on customer service teams\n\n\n\nIncrease client satisfaction\n\n\n\nSend information about news and updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome bots can actually cover the entire Meta ecosystem of apps and products. You can use the same chatbot platform to design virtual assistants for Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\n\n\nBut are all FB chatbots good?\n\n\n\nWell—not really.\n\n\n\nSome people refer to all fake Facebook accounts as “bots.” Sometimes bots (or advanced features of Facebook API) are used for scams or political propaganda.\n\n\n\nWhen describing the activities of state-sponsored political commentators, such as Russian web brigades, the terms such as “trolls” and “bots” are often used interchangeably. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they are real chatbots powered by artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can you tell if someone is a Facebook bot?\n\n\n\nIf you visit their profiles, bots and trolls usually share lots of resources. They seem very committed to commenting on controversial topics and taking a side. But they rarely share personal photos or details from their private lives. Or at least details other than generic pictures which seem random and don’t really create a believable feed timeline.\n\n\n\nRead more: Can you tell the difference between a human vs. AI? Take our test and find out. Also, learn more about what chatbots are and what they’re used for.\n\n\n\nAnd with Facebook live chatbots come great benefits. \n\n\n\nLet’s check them out.\n\n\n\nBenefits of a Facebook chatbot for business\n\n\n\nMessaging apps have revolutionized customer service and communication on social media platforms like Facebook. Their integration into the Facebook platform has opened up new avenues for businesses to enhance customer interaction and provide world-class customer support solutions. \n\n\n\nBy leveraging the benefits of an FB chatbot, companies can differentiate themselves in the market, create exceptional user experiences, and drive notable business growth.\n\n\n\nHere are some of the key advantages of using a Facebook chatbot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficient and scalable customer service\n\n\n\n\nOne of the primary benefits of using a chatbot is its ability to handle a large volume of customer conversations simultaneously. Unlike human agents, virtual assistants do not tire or require breaks, enabling them to provide support to multiple users at once. Studies show that virtual assistants can handle around 91% of customer service chats from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\nInstant access to support\n\n\n\n\nWith a Facebook chatbot, users have instant access to customer service and support agents. The chat window allows users to easily type their questions or concerns and receive relevant responses from the bot in real time. In fact, over 90% of shoppers rate “immediate response” as essential when they have a support question.\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover how Shockbyte decreased response time using Tidio chatbots.\n\n\n\n\nMarketing and conversion opportunities \n\n\n\n\nFacebook chatbot marketing can also be utilized for your campaigns and to boost sales. Chatbots can offer personalized product recommendations and turn conversations into sales opportunities. Research shows that, according to business leaders, chatbots increase sales by as much as 67%.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Grow sales with Facebook chatbots\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\n\n\n\nAnd now, onto the main features you should look out for in this software.\n\n\n\nMain features of a Messenger chatbot\n\n\n\nYou might say that the functionality of the bot depends purely on your needs. And that’s true to an extent because some features are useful for all companies. That’s due to the fact that they make your FB chatbot easier to use, utilize automation, and enable you to take advantage of multichannel communication.\n\n\n\nThe top features of the Facebook Messenger bots for business include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\n\n\n\nA chatbot that uses natural language processing (NLP) makes communication more natural while automating the customer support processes for you. This way, your agents will get fewer messages and be able to focus on the more complex queries while shoppers will be happy with their customer service experience.\n\n\n\n\nVariety of integrations\n\n\n\n\nIntegrations are crucial if you want to provide an omnichannel experience for your customers. This means that they’re able to reach you on a variety of platforms and get the exact same service quality. And your team’s able to see all the incoming messages in a single inbox so they never miss a sales opportunity.\n\n\n\n\nNo-code builder\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to spend thousands of dollars on development, then you need a Facebook AI chatbot that you can build without the need for coding. This usually means that you can drag and drop elements into the right places and teach your conversational AI by inputting past customer interactions into the system.\n\n\n\nYou’re probably wondering how to set up a chatbot on Facebook, so let’s look into that.\n\n\n\nHow to make a Facebook bot?\n\n\n\nCurrently, there is no native platform for creating chatbots for Facebook. The business version was released to a test group of users, but the project has still not been released for general use.\n\n\n\nHowever, there is a whole range of third-party solutions available on the market. You can try chatbot platforms such as Tidio, ManyChat, Chatfuel, or Customers.ai. Jump to the comparison of the best Facebook chatbots available on the market.\n\n\n\nTo build a Facebook chatbot, follow the steps below.\n\n\n\n1. Sign up for a free Tidio account\n\n\n\nGo to the registration page and create your free account. What’s good is that you don’t have to sign up with your Facebook account. You can use your FB login credentials, but it’s also perfectly alright to create an account with your email or Shopify account. Either way, you can integrate your Tidio profile and Facebook page later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re using an ecommerce platform like Shopify or WordPress, you can also install Tidio as a plugin.\n\n\n\n2. Set up your chat widget and customize it (optional)\n\n\n\nThe registration tour also involves setting up the look of your live chat widget. However, you should note that this step is optional. \n\n\n\nTidio can be used to manage your live chat, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and email conversations. You can add live chat to your website for omnichannel communication. But if you want to use it only as a tool for creating Messenger bots, configuring the widget doesn’t concern you. You can simply skip it and keep the default settings.\n\n\n\n3. Connect it with your Facebook business page\n\n\n\nWhen you open the main Tidio dashboard, click on Settings on the left side menu. Go to the Channels panel and click Facebook Messenger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can integrate your pages with Tidio by hitting the Connect Facebook Messenger button. Once you click the button, you’ll see a window with the integration steps. Log in to your Facebook account, choose the pages you want to integrate with Tidio, and give all the required permissions for the integration to work correctly. \n\n\n\nAfter that, you should see a message that Tidio is now linked to your Facebook page. Press OK and save the changes to confirm the integration.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn more about Tidio integration with Facebook Messenger.\n\n\n\n\n    Did you know that…    In order to comply with the EU privacy guidelines, Facebook introduced restrictions on Messenger API usage on December 16th, 2020. The changes to the Messenger API impact the platform, but can also influence the way you use the Tidio integration with Messenger.\n\n\n\n\n4. Design your conversation flows\n\n\n\nYou can keep things simple by using templates or creating advanced Facebook bots from scratch. Clicking on one of the decision buttons or adding a new one will open the visual drag-and-drop editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidio is a powerful bot builder. Some of its chat triggers use machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and natural language processing (NLP). It can send messages or analyze user intent, but it can also send funny GIFs, mobile phone notifications, or be integrated with Slack (via Zapier).\n\n\n\nYou can set up different conditions and advanced chatbot logic. It’s a good idea to customize your chatbot scripts and make them more in line with your business and customers.\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover how to design a chatbot workflow with best practices for bot design.\n\n\n\n5. Activate your Facebook bot\n\n\n\nOnce you get your chatbot decision trees ready, you can activate your bot. When your Facebook page visitors open your Messenger profile, the chatbot will send a welcome message. It’s a good idea to add an option to send messages as one of your main action buttons on the main page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome businesses even run Facebook Ads with Send message as their primary call-to-action buttons. Social networks are a great place for this type of ad campaign.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn all you need to know about business chatbots and how to get the most out of them.\n\n\n\nAnd what are some examples of effective chatbots on Facebook? Let’s have a look.\n\n\n\nFacebook Messenger bot examples\n\n\n\nFacebook has more than 1.96 billion daily active users that you can reach via Messenger. These virtual shopping assistants help to answer questions, find products, or deliver notifications about new content.\n\n\n\nFeel free to test drive a demo project prepared by Facebook. \n\n\n\nHere are some of the coolest marketing and support FB chatbot examples and use cases.\n\n\n\n1. LEGO bot\n\n\n\nOne of the most memorable virtual ecommerce assistants was developed by Lego. Ralph the giftbot was supposed to act as an interactive Lego catalog. It was launched before Christmas to help users pick the best gifts by answering a set of questions. The idea worked like a charm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is what the company’s representatives say about the project:\n\n\n\n\n\n    We are continuously searching for new and fun ways to engage with our consumers and shoppers. Chatbots are increasingly being used by brands to engage in the digital space, and in turn to drive sales. The Lego Group is one of the first in the toy industry to embrace this concept.\n    \n        \n        \n          \n              James Poulter              Senior Manager of Digital Consumer Engagement at Lego           \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\nThe Facebook bot campaign was featured in the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, and Poland. Currently, Ralph is “on vacation” but the company will certainly revisit conversational marketing campaigns using social media sooner or later.\n\n\n\n2. McDonald’s chatbot\n\n\n\nMcDonald’s designed a marketing campaign that incorporated a board game, discount codes, and FB Messenger bots. After scanning the board, you could chat with McBot and play a virtual game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter completing certain tasks, customers could win discount coupons and other gifts. Over 175,000 people participated in the campaign during the first week.\n\n\n\n3. Coca-Cola chatbot\n\n\n\nIt might seem that soft drinks are not an interesting topic of conversation. Okay, to be honest, they’re not. Talking to a Coca-Cola bot is unlikely to be a life-changing experience. But the company’s local branches and profiles have repeatedly used FB Messenger chatbots as part of marketing campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe example above comes from Coca-Cola Switzerland. A short conversation allows the company to collect customer feedback, inform clients about a new product, and give coupon codes. \n\n\n\nIt would be extremely difficult to encourage people to complete the same tasks if they were presented as a survey or a form.\n\n\n\n4. The Guardian bot\n\n\n\nMedia outlets have fallen in love with instant messaging, too. The Guardian deployed a Facebook chatbot that can send you top stories and article recommendations. You just need to answer a sequence of questions to help it choose the right pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can swipe between decision cards or change topic categories to find the most relevant articles.\n\n\n\n5. Disney chatbot\n\n\n\nAt some point, Disney released a whole range of different interactive characters powered by artificial intelligence that you could chat with. They were available via Messenger chatbots and Kik, but if you want, you could even try SMS texting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the most popular were Miss Piggy from The Muppets and Judy Hopps from Zootopia. Customers exchanged millions of messages with those two characters alone. \n\n\n\nObviously, it’s difficult to directly measure how these interactions translate into sales. However, some solutions offer advanced tools for measuring your bot’s performance.\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover how you can use chatbot analytics to measure your results.\n\n\n\nSince now you know how to create a Facebook chatbot, it’s time to also check out some of the tips and best practices for a successful implementation of your virtual assistants.\n\n\n\nDo’s and don’ts for a successful Facebook chatbot implementation\n\n\n\nImplementing a chatbot on Facebook can be a game-changer for your business, providing an efficient and effective way to engage with your customers. However, to ensure its success, you need to have a well-thought-out strategy in place. Here are some best practices that will help you with the implementation.\n\n\n\nDo: clearly define your objectives \n\n\n\nBefore diving into the development of your chatbot, set the objectives you want to achieve. Are you looking to enhance customer service, generate leads, or provide product recommendations? Having a clear understanding of your goals will guide the design and functionality of your chatbot.\n\n\n\nDon’t: make the chatbot too sales-y\n\n\n\nYour FB chatbot shouldn’t be too promotional. At least not at first.\n\n\n\nFirst, build trust and rapport with users by providing helpful information and resources before trying to directly sell them something. Move towards a sales pitch gradually after establishing value.\n\n\n\nDo: provide personalized experiences \n\n\n\nPersonalization is the key to delivering exceptional customer experiences. Use data collected from previous interactions or customer profiles to provide tailored recommendations or solutions. By making customers feel heard and understood, you can build lasting relationships and drive conversions.\n\n\n\nHere’s how Lidl helps people who aren’t wine experts choose the right wine to go with their meal. You can ask for recommendations of wines from specific countries, check which ones are in your planned price range, and what wine you should choose to pair tastefully with the dish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t: use too much complex jargon\n\n\n\nAlso, don’t assume users already have in-depth knowledge. Keep the chatbot’s language simple, avoid using industry buzzwords, and clearly explain any concepts the average user may not understand. Meet users at their level.\n\n\n\nDo: keep it conversational\n\n\n\nOne of the key benefits of chatbots is their ability to simulate human conversations. Ensure that your chatbot’s language is natural and conversational. Also, you should try, as often as possible, to use a friendly and relatable tone when communicating with your shoppers. Avoid sounding robotic or overly formal, as it may put off potential customers.\n\n\n\nDon’t: overwhelm users with too many on-screen options or buttons\n\n\n\nInstead, keep the chatbot’s interface clean and intuitive. Limit options to only the most used functions, and make sure buttons and menus are clearly labeled. \n\n\n\nComplexity will drive users away. \n\n\n\nAlso, try to build in some ability for the chatbot to understand and respond to natural human language, even if imperfectly. Users will expect some conversational capabilities.\n\n\n\nDo: incorporate AI and NLP\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies play a crucial role in enhancing the functionality of your chatbot. These technologies enable your bot to understand and interpret user queries accurately, leading to more personalized and effective responses.\n\n\n\nOne of the most advanced chatbots emerged from a partnership between Messenger and American Express—the AMEX Messenger bot. It uses AI to keep customers informed of transactions, provide tips, and suggest other products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t: launch the chatbot and abandon it\n\n\n\nYou should closely monitor performance, track key analytics, gather user feedback, and continuously refine the chatbot based on real-world usage. Plan for ongoing maintenance already while building your bots.\n\n\n\nDo: continuously monitor and improve \n\n\n\nDeploying a chatbot is not a one-time task. It requires continuous monitoring and improvement. So, ensure that you analyze user feedback and track metrics to quickly identify areas for improvement. This will help you regularly update your chatbot’s responses and functionalities to meet evolving customer expectations.\n\n\n\nDon’t: spam people\n\n\n\nIf you want shoppers to communicate with you, don’t be pushy and don’t spam them with messages. A simple “Hello, how can I help you?” is enough to engage with visitors. If they want to chat with you, they will. If they don’t, then it’s best to just leave them be until they’re ready for a conversation.\n\n\n\nSo, in short, implementing a successful Facebook chatbot software requires a comprehensive strategy that aligns with your business goals and meets the needs of your target audience. By defining clear objectives, personalizing experiences, leveraging AI and NLP, and continuously monitoring and improving, you can ensure a successful chatbot implementation that drives customer satisfaction and business growth.\n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nWhich platforms are best for building your Facebook Messenger AI chatbot?\n\n\n\nBest Facebook chatbots\n\n\n\nThere are many options out there that you can add to your Messenger platform including free chatbots, bots for lead generations, sales chatbots, and intelligent bots.
