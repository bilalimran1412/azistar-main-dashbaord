This feature can effectively route customer complaints from any of these channels to the appropriate agents. According to a CX report, 75% of customers expect a consistent experience from brands across several channels.\n\n\n\nSelf-service knowledge base\n\n\n\nYour software must enable your service team to create fully functional resource centers like FAQ pages, how-to-do articles, guides, and more.

For instance, these tools can provide shipping status or an order tracking number as soon as it is available. Research shows that over 60% of customers expect businesses to know their needs and expectations.\n\n\n\nImproved efficiency of support agents\n\n\n\nAutomation features, live chat triggers, and formatted responses hasten the routing of tickets to the relevant personnel. Agents can work faster and focus on specialized tasks since routine inquiries are answered using canned responses. A report indicates 24% of consumers keep engaging with a brand for two or more years after a positive experience with an agent.\n\n\n\nGet the best complaint management tool for your needs\n\n\n\nAs your business aims to be competitive and customer-focused, ensuring you get the right complaint management tool is necessary for this approach to succeed.
