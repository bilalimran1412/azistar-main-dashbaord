[Examples & Steps to Use] \n\n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nWhat is shared inbox software?\n\n\n\nA shared inbox software is a collaborative system where support teams can jointly respond to consumer queries. These inboxes are not owned by a single person but rather aggregate multiple email addresses into one inbox to manage team cooperation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour team will usually have access to a customer service email alias like support@ or info@ which allows them to work together on answering queries, troubleshooting problems, and in-channel communication. \n\n\n\nCollaborative inbox will provide features for employees to build workflows and tasks around email correspondence:\n\n\n\n\nCollision detection—collision happens when more agents respond to a consumer with different information. Shared inboxes prevent this by assigning tickets to reps. \n\n\n\nAutomated emails—this type of automation containing canned responses can be used for simple queries. The result is a quick turnaround for mundane customer emails. \n\n\n\nGroup email functionality—your team can respond to emails without having to log into personal accounts. Agents can work within the unified inbox to share information.\n\n\n\nWorkflow automation—with all emails flowing into one system, you can automate its team inbox management, i.e. create triggers to assign emails to specific team members. Also, automate repetitive tasks and streamline help desk workflows. \n\n\n\nInternal discussions—support agents can embed internal notes into each thread. If another agent picks up the correspondence, they can view all relevant talking points.\n\n\n\nAnalytics—team inbox provides analytics and tracking of response times and customer engagement, as well as reports that can feed into the wider customer care strategy. \n\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, let’s look at the best inbox management software for teams out there. \n\n\n\nRead more: Learn the differences between a distribution list and a shared inbox.\n\n\n\nTop 10 shared inbox software\n\n\n\nNow that you know what to look for in shared email software, you can compare the top inbox tools on the market.

Now, let’s take a look at some of the benefits that come with using them.\n\n\n\nShared inbox software benefits\n\n\n\nAside from identifying the best team inbox tool, you also need to know what benefits you can expect if you opt for one. \n\n\n\nA shared inbox serves as a central location for email correspondence, team collaboration, and keeping everyone informed on the status of requests. \n\n\n\nSome of the other common advantages of most shared inboxes include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling support operations \n\n\n\nAs your company grows and the number of team members increases, it can be difficult to keep track of multiple email accounts and responses. A shared mailbox can allow everyone to view incoming emails and who is responding to them in real time. Your team can manage email traffic and sort messages efficiently.\n\n\n\nCentralizing email communication to avoid confusion\n\n\n\nA unified inbox is important for managing hundreds of email queries by routing them to a single portal. Teams can communicate and work together without the constant back and forth between several personal emails. A central hub for email responses is a near necessity for any business when you consider that email users will grow to over 4 billion in 2026. \n\n\n\nReducing the workload for agents\n\n\n\nA team inbox allows everyone to have access to the same messages. Using a personal email account exposes agents to the risk of missing or ignoring emails. By having several agents working collectively to respond to messages, the burden on a single individual is less. \n\n\n\nEnhancing transparency and accountability\n\n\n\nShared inboxes make it easier for every message to receive the attention it deserves. Agents and admins can track email responses and the content therein. Moreover, if a team member is sick or unavailable, a colleague can refer to the previous thread and take on the correspondence. \n\n\n\nImproving customer service efficiency \n\n\n\nManaging several email accounts can be stressful for your employees. Using one gets them to share responsibility, avoid duplicating their efforts, and focus on quality service. A report has shown organizations that provide superior customer experiences receive a 4 to 8% bump in revenue than their competitors.  \n\n\n\nCreating permissions and controls\n\n\n\nA team inbox can be configured to set up different levels of access for team members based on their roles and responsibilities. You can reduce the risk of data breaches and maintain confidentiality within your team. Also, certain functions can be limited to admins or leaders in your business. \n\n\n\nRead more: Learn how to use permissions in Tidio.\n\n\n\nShared inboxes: key takeaway\n\n\n\nIf your support team is having efficiency issues, finds it hard to keep track of inbound requests, or needs a conducive online workspace to jointly resolve tickets, then it’s high time you sign up for a shared inbox tool. A dedicated team inbox has many benefits and makes it easier for your agents to stay on top of email requests. \n\n\n\nWe recommend Tidio as our best software among the options we listed. Tidio’s shared inbox for teams allows you to manage communication from several channels and automates responses using AI chatbots. These and other practical features lead to higher productivity and foster teamwork within your organization. \n\n\n\nWhy not give it a try?\nShare this article:Jelisaveta SapardicTidio’s Content Writer with a passion for languages.
