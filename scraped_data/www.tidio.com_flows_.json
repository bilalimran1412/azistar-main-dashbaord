Tidio Flows are designed to understand your visitors’ inquiries and engage in simple tasks based on specific triggers.\n \nA trigger is essentially a Flow node that tells the program when to start. Each new workflow always starts with a trigger. Think of something like “if X happens, then do Y”, but with more rules and parameters.\nFlows can handle common questions, such as queries about hours of business or simple transactions that don’t involve a lot of variables.What can I use Flows for?Tidio Flows can accomplish a variety of tasks, but they’re generally used to replace human operators in online conversations or to engage website visitors. They can be a powerful tool, helping you start chats with website visitors, answer FAQs, generate leads, save abandoned carts, cross-sell products, and more.Are Tidio Flows free?Tidio’s free-forever plan gives you access to 100 Flows triggers. Simply put, the free plan enables you to engage up to 100 unique visitors per month via Flows. Once your business grows and your website starts attracting significant traffic, you can upgrade to one of our paid plans that expand your Flows limit so you can engage more visitors each month.Do I need to know coding to build a Flow?You don’t need any coding skills to build Flows. With Tidio, you can easily create and customize Flows with a visual editor – without writing a single line of code.How can I make a Flow?Your Tidio account gives you unlimited access to 40+ Flows templates. You can activate a template with a few clicks, and you can customize it using our drag-and-drop Flows builder. If you want to create a Flow from scratch, you can use our visual editor to combine different rules and triggers.What are the benefits of using Flows?The main benefits of using Flows include:Easier lead generation and nurturingIncreased salesLower customer service costsIncreased customer engagement and satisfactionIncreased team productivity24/7 automated customer supportWhat businesses should use Flows?Flows are ideal for any business that gets a lot of customer queries and/or offers a variety of products.
