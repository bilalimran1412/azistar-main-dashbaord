The software can understand customer questions, answer common queries, handle simple tasks automatically, and much more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe software improves with every interaction it has with people. The built-in machine learning engine improves itself by identifying patterns in customer questions. Over time, your team has fewer and fewer repetitive tasks to handle, freeing up time to nurture customer relationships and offer a human touch.\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover the differences between chatbots vs conversational AI with examples of both.\n\n\n\nExamples of AI in customer support\n\n\n\nThere are a variety of AI solutions for customer service. Let’s look at each one individually, but bear in mind that some platforms bundle these solutions together in packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI-powered chatbots \n\n\n\nA 24/7 frontline team that is good at handling the basics, such as FAQs, password resets, and checking order status—i.e. simple questions that eat up a lot of time. Some AI systems understand customer sentiment and figure out when to hand the conversation over to a live agent.\n\n\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) \n\n\n\nNLP chatbots make it feel like you’re talking to a person rather than a robot. It helps the AI understand the nuance of human speech and get to the bottom of what people are actually asking.\n\n\n\nVirtual assistants \n\n\n\nAn AI virtual assistant understands more complex tasks and might have voice capabilities. Some can reschedule appointments or walk people through a product setup based on their purchase history.\n\n\n\nAutomated ticketing systems \n\n\n\nAutomated ticketing systems remove the need for manual sorting by fielding incoming messages and emails. This technology figures out what the customer needs, and automatically forwards the details to the right agent.\n\n\n\nVoice recognition systems \n\n\n\nVoice recognition systems enable users to direct technology by speaking to it. This makes it easy to perform hands-free tasks and get responses. Different voices are identified using automatic speech recognition software.\n\n\n\nTop 10 AI customer support software options\n\n\n\nWith so many options available, we thought it would be helpful to compile a list of the best AI customer support software to consider. \n\n\n\nHere’s a comparison table of the tools:\n\n\n\nSoftwareG2 ratingFree planBest forTidio4.7/5 ⭐️✅AI chatbotsZendesk4.3/5 ⭐️ 14-day free trialIntuitive interfaceFreshdesk4.4/5 ⭐️ ✅Analytics and reportingKustomer4.4/5 ⭐️ Six-month free trialAutomated data managementHelp Scout4.4/5 ⭐️ 15-day free trialRobust APIsDialogflow4.4/5 ⭐️ $300 in free creditsAI voice recognitionIntercom4.5/5 ⭐️ 14-day free trialCollision detectionHubspot4.4/5 ⭐️ ✅Contact managementTiledesk4.7/5 ⭐️ 14-day free trialMultichannel Zoho Desk4.4/5 ⭐️ 15-day free trialAutomated ticket assignment\n\n\n\nAnd here are detailed reviews of the best AI platforms for your customer service team:\n\n\n\n1.

But that’s not all of the benefits that AI-powered customer service can provide for your business. \n\n\n\nHere are several key areas where AI customer service solutions can benefit your business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24/7 availability\n\n\n\nAI never sleeps, making it ideal for businesses with a global customer base or those who need to offer support outside traditional business hours. Even when your team is offline, AI can provide real-time support, handle basic inquiries or collect visitor information. \n\n\n\nIn fact, over 51% of shoppers admitted that they need ecommerce stores to be available at 24/7 for their convenience. \n\n\n\nDecreased response time\n\n\n\nLong waiting time ruins the customer experience for almost 60% of people. But AI can speed things up by automating simple tasks, and helping agents with more complex support queries. This includes analyzing incoming inquiries, gathering relevant user information, determining urgency, and providing self-service options for the visitor.\n\n\n\nIncreased lead generation\n\n\n\nAI-powered lead generation makes it much easier to find potential customers. It goes beyond simple website scraping and helps to find ready-to-buy leads. The system does this by analyzing your past sales data (customer profiles, purchase histories, etc.), and finding common traits among your best customers. It then uses these patterns to find new leads that share those desirable characteristics.\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover how Endeksa increased lead generation by 138% using Tidio.\n\n\n\nLower costs\n\n\n\nThe potential efficiency gains of AI customer service software add up to noticeable savings over time. Of course, you need to factor in the initial cost for the platform itself, along with any setup or integration help you might need.\n\n\n\nThe key is to think long-term. The savings come from reducing the workload on your human team and the potential for scaling your support without needing to proportionally scale your headcount.\n\n\n\nPersonalized experience\n\n\n\nThink back to the last time you received good customer service. What made it stand out? It’s likely that you felt like your specific needs were taken into account. You didn’t feel like a number or just another customer. \n\n\n\nA good quality AI system tailors support by gathering customer data from past purchases and interactions, website behavior, and demographics. This is important as a Gartner study revealed that brands focusing on “help me” personalization can expect a 16% lift in commercial benefits.\n\n\n\nValuable insights\n\n\n\nAnother major benefit of AI customer service software is that it does a lot more than deliver basic analytics. You can use it to gain actionable customer insights from your raw data, helping you understand your customers on a whole new level.\n\n\n\nMany AI tools for customer service analyze how shoppers interact with your company across multiple channels, identifying browsing trends, purchases, and support needs. Even more than that, using NLP, the AI model can work out the emotions behind customer feedback to give you insights into sentiment.\n\n\n\nImplementing AI customer support software: common challenges\n\n\n\nSometimes the functionality of the AI solution for customer support isn’t enough to achieve the desired customer engagement. And f you’re looking to implement AI tools for customer service for the first time, then it’s useful to understand the common challenges and limitations of these systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLack of human touch\n\n\n\nWhen customers seek support, they’re often looking for understanding and compassion. AI responses lack the emotional nuance and empathy to deal with tricky situations where extra sensitivity may be needed.\n\n\n\nSolution to the challenge:A hybrid customer service model that combines AI and human agents is best. AI handles the routine tasks, while more complex issues are escalated to support agents.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn what are the biggest chatbot challenges and how to solve them.\n\n\n\nInaccurate or robotic responses\n\n\n\nAI systems might respond in a way that is irrelevant or too robotic. AI chatbots have a tendency to be too “wordy” or stilted in style. This system sometimes misunderstands queries due to limited learning data, which can be frustrating for the customer.\n\n\n\nSolution to the challenge:Offer AI chatbots with Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities that better understand the context of queries. Regularly update the AI system with new data and customer interaction insights.\n\n\n\nIntegration difficulties\n\n\n\nIntegration of AI customer service software into existing workflows can be challenging. This can potentially lead to service delivery disruption and inefficiencies.\n\n\n\nSolution to the challenge:Find an AI customer support solution that integrates more easily with third-party software and workflows. Custom integration solutions or middleware can also make things smoother. For example, Tidio offers over 35 integrations, so you can easily connect your other tools with this customer service platform.\n\n\n\nContext and intent understanding\n\n\n\nAI may struggle to understand the intent behind a customer’s query, especially if it’s complex or multi-layered. This can result in responses that don’t fully address the customer’s needs or end up in multiple interactions.\n\n\n\nSolution to the challenge:\n\n\n\nNLP and deep learning AI systems can help the technology grasp the nuance of customer queries. You can train the technology with common queries and question-answer pairs from your FAQ page. Updating the dataset with more interactions can help the AI to recognize intent more accurately.\n\n\n\nAI customer support software: key takeaways \n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence is a great way to improve the speed of customer support by automating certain elements.\n\n\n\nBy using features such as AI-powered chatbots, NLP and automated help desk, you can easily take care of simple, repetitive tasks at the first point of contact with a customer. However, a hybrid approach that combines AI with human agents is best, as complex interactions often need a more empathetic and nuanced approach.\n\n\n\nSo—what’s the best AI customer support solution?\n\n\n\nAlthough there are dozens of AI customer service providers available, only a few stand out above the others, including Tidio, Intercom, and Tiledesk for their advanced AI features.\n\n\n\nWhy not try one of the best AI customer support solutions on the market today?\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Enjoy the benefits of an AI customer service tool from today\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about AI chatbots        \n            \n\nShare this article:Beata StefanowiczContent Writer at Tidio with a love for the written word.
