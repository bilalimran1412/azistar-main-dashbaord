Now let’s see what features you should look out for when choosing your chatbot platform. \n\n\n\nMust-have chatbot builder features\n\n\n\nSo, what to look out for in a chatbot maker platform when you’re choosing one for your business? For the most part, it’s the ability to customize it without any coding knowledge and great customer support from the chatbot company. \n\n\n\nBut that’s not all. Let’s look at the most essential features one by one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. High customization and personalization options \n\n\n\nAccording to a survey, about 35% of customers are frustrated by impersonal service. So, give your chatbot a personality and improve the customer experience. \n\n\n\nThis is one of the key requirements for a chatbot builder because over 80% of your site visitors interact with your bot for quick inquiries. Make sure you deliver good customer service and leave a great impression on all clients with a customized bot that feels personal. But to do this, the chatbot creator you choose must give you the opportunity to customize the bot to your needs. \n\n\n\n2. No code required\n\n\n\nIf you’re not a programmer, you probably don’t know much about coding. So, the chatbot you’re creating shouldn’t require any programming skills for you to build your bot. This is important because if coding is not your strong skill, you might get discouraged from using chatbots altogether. \n\n\n\nThat’s why a no-code bot builder drag-and-drop interface would be ideal as it provides a good user experience and it’s efficient in creating your conversation flowchart. A no-code chatbot builder is fast, simple, and easy to use by anyone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Great customer support\n\n\n\nWhen you start building chatbots, you will encounter issues from where to find the chatbot creator on the dashboard to how to use its triggers effectively. Everyone does at the beginning. The crucial thing is to have support and overcome the problem so you can smoothly move on and continue with building. \n\n\n\nSo, look at ratings and the reviews people leave on G2 and filter them by phrases like “customer service” and “customer support”. Go through what other users are saying about their client experience and learn if the reps are helpful enough to assist with the issues. \n\n\n\nGreat customer support is not just about quick responses or being friendly during the chat. It’s important, but the representatives also need to be knowledgeable and help you when you need assistance. It will make the process of building your chatbot easier and more efficient.\n\n\n\nRead more: Find out how Suitor made the most out of their customer support efforts and automated 85% of queries with Tidio.\n\n\n\n4. AI chatbots available\n\n\n\nTo put it simply, there are two types of chatbots: rule-based and AI chatbots. \n\n\n\nRule-based chatbots (also known as decision-tree bots) communicate through pre-defined rules and a set of questions. They are guided by a decision tree and give users a set of options to reach the desired answer. \n\n\n\nOn the other hand, AI-powered chatbots are built using machine learning models and learn to make connections between customer questions to generate appropriate answers. They can build on top of the pre-programmed commands to chat with clients more effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choice is yours, but you can also go for an AI chatbot builder that will combine both types of chatbots to match your business needs.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Enhance customer communication using Tidio’s AI chatbot\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about AI chatbots        \n            \n\n\n\n\nRead more: Explore real-life examples of chatbots and use cases with artificial intelligence. \n\n\n\n5. Language range\n\n\n\nThis one is important for international brands. So, if your business operates internationally, then you need to provide the same great customer service options for everyone. That’s where multilingual options come into play.\n\n\n\nSometimes your clients will write sentences that mean the same thing, but they will phrase them differently. The point is—your chatbot needs to understand what they’re saying to assist them properly. \n\n\n\nAnd not just one group of clients, but also users from across the globe who don’t speak the same language as you do. Including more groups of users, creating a great experience, and making them feel at home can help you grow your business more efficiently and rapidly. \n\n\n\nKey takeaway: what’s the best chatbot builder?\n\n\n\nWhich one you’ll go for depends entirely on your business. So, when you’re planning to start creating a bot, make sure to define what’s important for your brand and that the bot builder of your choice has what you need. \n\n\n\nHere’s a quick recap—\n\n\n\nBest chatbot builder for small-to-medium businesses:\n\n\n\n\nTidio\n\n\n\n\nBest Facebook chatbot builders:\n\n\n\n\nManyChat\n\n\n\nChatfuel\n\n\n\n\nBest WhatsApp Business bot creator:\n\n\n\n\nWATI \n\n\n\n\nBest free chatbot makers:\n\n\n\n\nHubSpot \n\n\n\n\nBest chatbot companies for larger businesses:\n\n\n\n\nTARS \n\n\n\nAivo\n\n\n\nChatBot \n\n\n\n\nBest chatbot creator for collecting customer information: \n\n\n\n\nOutgrow\n\n\n\n\nChatbot builders: Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\nWhich chatbot builders are the easiest to use?
