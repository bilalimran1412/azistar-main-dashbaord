Here are the main ways in which you can use chatbots in many stages of the sales process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide omnichannel experience\n\n\n\nYou can add chatbots for sales to many different channels including social media, website, and messaging platforms to provide an omnichannel experience for your shoppers. This can also help you monetize your social media accounts, as clients will be able to order through your bot without leaving the platform. \n\n\n\nStudies show that social media sales can generate over 50% of revenue when done right. And this has shown to be the case across 14 major industries, such as healthcare and logistics, not just ecommerce!\n\n\n\nYou can also play the long game—deploy chatbots to advertise your brand on a variety of platforms and expand your reach. This will help your sales funnel by spreading brand awareness, getting more leads, and collecting customer data to define the buying behaviors of your clients. \n\n\n\nRead more: Discover the best customer experience software to use for your business. \n\n\n\nSave abandoned carts\n\n\n\nThe average abandonment rate for ecommerce is estimated at around 70%. That’s a lot of customers to lose after you’ve put effort into attracting them to your website. \n\n\n\nIn order to reduce it, you can try to provide free shipping, easy checkout, etc. But the easiest way to cut this rate down is to add a seller chatbot to your site that can stop potential customers from leaving without completing the purchase. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales chatbots can also ask your visitors why they’re abandoning their carts. Maybe you can fix the problem quickly and easily to land a sale. And the best part is, your sales reps don’t have to spend time on this tedious task. Simply trigger the bot when the visitor’s cursor moves off your page. \n\n\n\nBut why wait until the potential customer is about to leave when you can prevent the abandoned cart way earlier than that? Sales chatbots provide real-time assistance for visitors in choosing the right products, answering support questions, explaining different costs, and providing discounts. This improves the shopping experience and motivates shoppers to complete their checkout.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn the best ways to reduce shopping cart abandonment and increase your revenue. \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Save more abandoned carts with chatbots and watch your sales grow\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\n\n\n\nIncrease lead generation\n\n\n\nAnother example of how chatbots help your business increase sales is by delivering qualified leads straight to your sales team. You can design them to identify warm leads, spark interest in your website visitors, and build relationships with prospects. \n\n\n\nIn fact, about 55% of businesses using AI chatbots generate more high-quality leads. Also, research shows that brands who reply to their potential customers within an hour of receiving a query are seven times more likely to qualify the prospect.\n\n\n\nAnd this is where selling chatbots come into place. For starters, their response time is much quicker than any other service tool. This means they can answer your shoppers’ queries within seconds and use conversational AI to get the prospect’s information. \n\n\n\nSo, which features are most useful for lead generation?Sales bots can use chat surveys, sign-up forms, and order phone calls.
