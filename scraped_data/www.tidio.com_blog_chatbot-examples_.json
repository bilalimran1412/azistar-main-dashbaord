The current chatbot landscape is very diverse and exciting. And we’ll talk about how different businesses can use the various chatbots and AI systems.We’ll cover everything from Japanese teenage girl chatbots that become suicidal to intelligent ecommerce chatbot examples.\n\n\n\nThe best chatbot examples are:\n\n\n\n\nLyro—a chatbot to enhance customer experience\n\n\n\nKuki—an AI chatbot to have an everyday chat with\n\n\n\nMeena—open-domain chatbot by Google\n\n\n\nBlenderBot—Facebook chatbot that can search the web\n\n\n\nRose AI—an AI for finding, organizing, visualizing data\n\n\n\nReplika—AI friend that understands the context of your messages\n\n\n\nEviebot—artificial intelligence companion with emotional understanding\n\n\n\nTay—chatbot for Twitter made by Microsoft\n\n\n\nVivibot—a chatbot for cancer patients to help with their mindset\n\n\n\nXiaoice—AI system based on emotional computing framework\n\n\n\nDomino’s Messenger bot—chatbot for ordering your meal\n\n\n\nInsomnobot 3000—bot to speak to at night \n\n\n\nReal Estate chatbot—for real estate companies\n\n\n\nWoebot—Mental health bot available via an app\n\n\n\nBuoy—health chatbot that checks your symptoms\n\n\n\nRoo—sexual health educational bot\n\n\n\nNightbot—chatbot for automating live stream chats on Twitch, YouTube, and Trovo \n\n\n\nMya—human resources chatbot to help with department tasks\n\n\n\nMondly—chatbot for learning languages\n\n\n\nVisual Dialog—chatbot that can read the images provided\n\n\n\nGlobe Telecom—bot for frequently asked customer service questions\n\n\n\nChirpy Cardinal Chatterbot—modern, social chatbot used for discussions\n\n\n\nSiri—AI by Apple that communicates verbally with users\n\n\n\nLaMDA—AI bot engine that uses machine learning technology\n\n\n\nMeet Einstein Bot—a multi-channel, multilingual bot for your website\n\n\n\nPepper—robot created by Softbank to connect and assist people\n\n\n\n\nLet’s dive in and explore the most innovative chatbots one by one.\n\n\n\n1. Lyro customer support AI\n\n\n\nIf you are an online store or any other business that handles many customers, you should know one thing.\n\n\n\nChatbots give you a competitive advantage. \n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nThree words: real-time customer service.\n\n\n\nCurrent customer experience trends show that online shoppers expect their questions answered fast. Like, yesterday. Otherwise, they take their business elsewhere.\n\n\n\nIntroducing Lyro, the revolutionary chatbot example powered by AI technology and deep learning. Elevate your customer support efficiency and boost user satisfaction effortlessly. This cutting-edge bot engages website visitors in natural conversations, delivering exceptional experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLyro’s self-learning capability enables it to handle up to 80% of frequently asked questions. So you don’t even need to spend time training it. It’s also a scalable solution that grows with your business and changes according to your needs.\n\n\n\nThis conversational chatbot can:\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand context and intent of messages\n\n\n\nUse NLP to chat with users in a natural language \n\n\n\nTrain itself on your company information\n\n\n\nAutomatically make FAQ chatbots\n\n\n\n\nAnd our findings show that Lyro can handle up to 70% of customer service questions while decreasing first response time by 75%. Why not take it for a spin?\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Find out how Lyro can help you grow your business\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about AI chatbots        \n            \n\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn how Lyro helped Bella Sante increase sales and lead generation\n\n\n\n2. Kuki AI Companion\n\n\n\nDo you want to talk to AI right now? Mitsuku should be a good choice. There is no need to sign up or download any app.\n\n\n\nYou can test this chatbot and chat with Mtisuku here\n\n\n\nMitsuku is the most popular online chatbot and it won the Loebner Prize Turing Test four times. Try to beat that! Oh… you probably can. But only because you are a human and not just pretending to be one.\n\n\n\nSo—\n\n\n\nIs Mitsuku the smartest chatbot in the world?\n\n\n\nIt is one of the best chatbot examples that use AI. Mitsuku uses Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity (A.L.I.C.E.) database. It also enhances its conversation skills with advanced machine learning techniques.\n\n\n\nStill, the technology is slightly old and, reportedly, pales by comparison with some new solutions from Google. Mitsuku scores 23% lower than Google’s Meena on the Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA). However, the metric itself was designed by the Google AI team—which means it could be slightly biased.\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover how AI stereotypes us and insights into the consequences of AI biases.\n\n\n\nWhat is the easiest way to implement an AI chatbot on your website?\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to have your own Artificial Intelligence chatbot, try building one with the chatbot editor powered by Tidio. The AI Responder is one of many chatbot examples that use the language processing node. Find out more about AI chatbots here.\n\n\n\n\n3. Meena by Google\n\n\n\nMeena is a revolutionary conversational AI chatbot developed by Google. They claim that it is the most advanced conversational agent to date. Its neural AI model has been trained on 341 GB of public domain text.\n\n\n\nThe model tries to come up with utterances that are both very specific and logical in a given context. Meena is capable of following many more conversation nuances than other chatbot examples.\n\n\n\nHere is the chatbot AI comparison published on Google AI Blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe still have to take Google’s word for it. They haven’t released Meena yet and there is no way to test it first hand.\n\n\n\nIf you are eager to play around with chatbots right here and now, visit our chatbot templates library. You can test out popular chatbots for various industries without signing up.\n\n\n\n4. BlenderBot by Facebook\n\n\n\nAfter years of research, Facebook built their own open-source chatbot AI. It’s called BlenderBot because it can blend different conversational skills.\n\n\n\nFacebook developers claim to have beaten Google’s AI chatbot. Reportedly, 75% of users preferred a long conversation with BlenderBot rather than Meena.\n\n\n\nHowever, a virtual date with Kuki (Mitsuku) turned out to be less successful. During an event called Bot Battle, the two AIs were talking for 2 weeks straight. Their conversation was streamed live and the viewers voted for the smarter chatbot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost 80% of viewers voted for Kuki. But this can be attributed to the dorky design of the BlenderBot avatar and the “Make Facebook Great Again” baseball cap. This guy seems kinda familiar, wouldn’t you agree?\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up:\n\n\n\n\nGoogle claims that users prefer Meena to Kuki\n\n\n\nFacebook claims that users prefer BlenderBot to Meena\n\n\n\nThe internet believes that Kuki is smarter than BlenderBot\n\n\n\n\nThere is a difference between AI chatbot technology developed by Facebook and chatbots designed for Facebook Messenger. To learn more about Facebook chatbots read our guide.\n\n\n\n5. Rose AI Chatbot\n\n\n\nRose is an AI chatbot with a strong backstory. She is a former security consultant, lives in San Francisco, and likes Florence and the Machine. Rose is a chatbot with an attitude that makes her quite memorable.\n\n\n\nChat with Rose now\n\n\n\nThe chatbot was developed by Bruce Wilcox and his wife Sue Wilcox (he is the programmer, she is the writer). Wilcox believes in chatbots with sparkling personalities. He had also created the infamous Talking Angela cat. It stirred much controversy because of a hoax perpetrated by parents concerned with child safety.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn all about different chatbot types and find out which one works best for your business needs.\n\n\n\n6. Replika: AI Friend\n\n\n\nHow can you mend a broken heart in 2022? Talk to a chatbot. We live in interesting times in which people flirt with chatbots or complain to them about their failed relationships.\n\n\n\nReplika: My AI Friend is the most popular virtual companion chatbot right now. It comes as a mobile app and already has more than 5,000,000 installations.\n\n\n\nAs the chatbot name suggests, Replika’s chatbots use AI to become just like you. They chat with you and collect information from your social media accounts to learn everything there is to know. A Replika chatbot is like a therapist that listens to you and takes notes.\n\n\n\nAnd then, it replicates you.\n\n\n\nWait, what?\n\n\n\nYup. They become both your AI companions and your virtual clones.\n\n\n\nYou can get the Replika app here and try it out\n\n\n\nThe majority of its users are young men who treat their Replikas as a sort of virtual girlfriends. If you upgrade your account, you can leave the friend zone and start a romantic relationship. This means that most Replika users are in relationships with digital versions of themselves, but of the opposite sex (most of the time).\n\n\n\nThe idea behind the app may seem strange at first but—if you think about it—it makes perfect sense. What guy wouldn’t want to meet someone “just like him” but wearing a head bow? Take a look at Mickey Mouse and Minnie. They seem like a happy couple.\n\n\n\nStill, many Replika reviews read like this one:\n\n\n\n\nLike having a conversation with a crayon. This thing literally never remembers what you say. Still trying to teach it 1+1 for a week straight. After it threatened to kill me and called me insane, I was done.\nThe BunzGoogle Play Store, February 24, 2021\n\n\n\nIs Replika safe?Replika does not breach your privacy any more than other popular apps. It can be addictive (but so is Instagram/Facebook/TikTok) and some users think it’s creepy. Most of the incidents reported by users are Natural Language Processing hiccups. All chatbots can be easily tricked into saying or confirming pretty much anything. The app is not cursed, despite various urban legends.\n\n\n\n7. Eviebot by Existor\n\n\n\nEvie is a learning chatbot using the Cleverbot engine. It was built by Existor and it uses software created by Rollo Carpenter. Eviebot has become a viral phenomenon after YouTubers started flirting with her and recorded their efforts.\n\n\n\nTalk to Eviebot on the official website\n\n\n\nEviebot seems creepy to some users because of the uncanny valley effect. Her resemblance to a human being is unsettlingly high in some aspects. At the same time, it falls short of being truly convincing.\n\n\n\nThere are many other interesting chatbots powered by Cleverbot. For example, Boibot is a male version of Eviebot. And Willbot looks like William Shakespeare and speaks Early Modern English.\n\n\n\nExistor is a machine learning company that uses Cleverbot to find customers for their services and solutions. The chatbots like Eviebot are in fact discrete lead generation tools. That’s clever!\n\n\n\nChatbots and lead generationChatbots are a cool alternative to pop-ups. If you want to turn your website visitors into subscribers, check how online stores do it with bots. Read our chatbot case studies—at the end of each, you’ll find tutorials. All of them describe real-life scenarios.\n\n\n\n8. Tay by Microsoft\n\n\n\nThis AI chatbot example reminds me of something. I was a little kid and I stayed at my aunt’s for several days. When my parents picked me up they were in for a shock. It turned out that—with a little help from my cousins—I learned to swear like a docker!\n\n\n\nPretty much the same thing happened to Tay—an AI chatbot that was supposed to speak like a teenage girl. Its creators let it roam free on Twitter and mingle with regular users of the internet.\n\n\n\nWell, that sounds like a brilliant idea. What could possibly go wrong, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took less than an hour to turn Microsoft’s chatbot into a genocidal racist. To be fair, it wasn’t Tay’s fault. The AI was pretty much like a child who doesn’t mean any harm or offense and parrots others without a clue. The internet trolls were the ones to blame.\n\n\n\nTay was originally supposed to be the best conversational AI that could act as a customer service host for web services. But we can only assume that talking to it could become the raw material for quite a few customer service horror stories.\n\n\n\nThe technology itself worked fine but the incident left a bad taste in the mouth. That’s why Tay is one of the best chatbot examples and worst chatbot examples at the same time.\n\n\n\n9. Vivibot by HopeLab\n\n\n\nChatbots can sometimes become friends or even therapists. They can have their own personality and become a soul mate for people who are going through a tough time in their life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk with Vivibot now\n\n\n\n\nVivibot is an innovative chatbot that was designed to assist young people who have cancer or whose family members are going through cancer treatment. By answering their questions and interacting with them on a regular basis, Vivibot helps teenagers cope with the disease.\n\n\n\n\nThese chatbots are a great first step for people who may be experiencing a sad or depressed mood or anxiety to reclaim their mental health. \n—Danielle Ramo, one of Vivibot’s creators\n\n\n\nExperts claim that mental health chatbots cannot replace interacting with real humans. But they can become a helpful part of therapy.\n\n\n\n10. Xiaoice by Microsoft\n\n\n\nXiaoice is an AI system developed by Microsoft for the Chinese market. It is the predecessor of Tay and one of the most recognizable girl chatbots of the era. \n\n\n\nXiaoice—or more accurately Xiaobing— means “little ice/little bing.” It is no coincidence. The AI is powered by the Microsoft Bing search engine.\n\n\n\nUpon her initial release, Xiaoice received 1.5 million chat invitations in 3 days. The chatbot girl became extremely popular on platforms such as Weibo (a Chinese alternative to Facebook).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReportedly, Xiaoice is a real flirt too. Many users fell head over heels in love. The “empathic computing framework” used in Xiaoice’s AI was quite revolutionary. And it made it really easy to connect with the chatbot on an emotional level. Interestingly, this system also backfired. Rinna—Xiaoice’s Japanese relative—became “suicidal.”\n\n\n\nFlirting with chatbots is not uncommon and adult chatbots and sexbots are a phenomenon in their own right.\n\n\n\n11. Domino’s Messenger Bot\n\n\n\nNowadays, customers can order their food without making a single phone call. All thanks to customer service chatbots. A few buttons—start, choose what you want, enter the address, and done!\n\n\n\nThere are many examples of chatbots in the food industry but Domino’s chatbot stands out. \n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nBecause it is so damn convenient and simple! It has one job and it does it well. Many chatbots fail because people expect too much of them. It’s not the case here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominos’ pizza chatbot lives in Facebook Messenger. That means that customers can place orders from different devices. The bot remembers your order history so re-ordering is possible. This chatbot can also track orders and estimate the time of delivery.\n\n\n\n\n        If you own a restaurant, you may be interested in restaurant chatbot. They can help you with booking, take orders, or show new items on your menu.\n\n\n\n\n12. Insomnobot 3000 by Casper\n\n\n\nThis chatbot is part of a marketing campaign by Caspar. The company, which sells mattresses and sheets, prepared a funny bot to get publicity. And it worked like a charm.\n\n\n\nThe idea is very simple. Casper created a landing page with a chatbot for insomniacs that will text you if you can’t fall asleep.\n\n\n\nInsomnobot 3000 caught the attention of many journalists. The quirky chatbot obsessed with night snacks made a nice clickbait story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a good example of conversation marketing and its viral potential. You create a virtual being you can talk to and everyone wants to try it out. Insomnobot 3000 is just the right amount of original, funny, and outlandish.\n\n\n\nIf are looking for other marketing chatbot examples and use cases of bots in marketing, check out: Chatbot Marketing 101: Fast, Easy Guide and Steps\n\n\n\n13. Real Estate Chatbot\n\n\n\nChatbots can help you book hotels, restaurants, airplane tickets, or even sell houses. A virtual assistant you can chat with can give you a personalized offer. All it takes is several simple questions.\n\n\n\nWhen customers have to browse through many options to look for the right deal, it’s always better to do it with bots. That’s why real estate businesses and chatbots are a match made in heaven.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conversation design is tailor-made for the real estate industry. It covers typical scenarios that agents deal with every day.\n\n\n\nRead more: Why Should I Use Chatbots in Real Estate?\n\n\n\n14. Weobot: Mental Health Bot\n\n\n\nWoebot is a chatbot that helps with your mental health. Its chatbot conversation scripts are a sort of automated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. If you want to try out Woebot, download the app, create an account, and you are ready to talk your problems away.\n\n\n\nMost of the conversations use quick replies—you choose one of the suggested dialog options. It feels like an interactive, conversational psychological test.\n\n\n\nYou can download this chatbot app from their website \n\n\n\nThe app has many positive reviews and users find it very beneficial. Obviously, just like all chatbots, Weobot is very kind and agreeable to whatever you write. If by accident it tells you that killing yourself is a great idea indeed (like another popular medical chatbot), it does it out of misguided politeness—not because it wants to exterminate the human race.\n\n\n\n15. Buoy Health Chatbot\n\n\n\nMedical robots need human assistance to conduct robotic surgical procedures. Similarly, chatbots used in healthcare are not meant to replace real doctors. But they can assist medical professionals and simplify processes such as triage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuoy is an example of an AI tool that simulates a conversation with a doctor. Buoy chatbot uses its database of tens of thousands of clinical records. Then it chooses the best patient interview questions on the go.\n\n\n\nThe bot has been tested on a large group of patients. They talked with the chatbot and saw their doctor afterward. The company claims that the diagnosis overlapped in more than 90% of the cases.\n\n\n\n16. Roo: Educational Bot\n\n\n\nTalking to kids about “bees and flowers” is a tricky business.\n\n\n\nSo, When mommy and daddy love each other very much… Well. Umm. You know what? Maybe I’ll let the robot explain it. \n\n\n\nJoking aside, sex education and sexual health awareness are at a dire level. The subject is awkward and very sensitive. Most of us don’t feel comfortable talking about our doubts or health questions related to sex. That’s exactly why projects like Roo are important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk to Roo chatbot now\n\n\n\n\nLet’s face it—\n\n\n\nIf you were a teenager, who would you more enjoy talking about your sex life to? A chatbot or your school counselor?\n\n\n\n17. Nightbot for Twitch\n\n\n\nStream bots are a separate kind of chatbots. In point of fact, you can’t chat with them—if by chatting we mean an exchange of messages.\n\n\n\nBots used for streamers don’t have complex chatbot conversation flows. But you can use them for many other things. For instance, you can type in specific commands and the stream bots will send messages or perform selected moderation actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNightbot is one of the best Twitch and YouTube bot examples. You can use it to engage your audience while streaming and answer frequent questions. It is cloud-based and has advanced spam detection filters. \n\n\n\nIf you need to automate your communication with viewers, Nightbot is the way to go. However, if you need to add a chat to your website, you should consider one of the popular chatbot platforms.\n\n\n\n18. Mya: HR Chatbot\n\n\n\nMya is an example of an AI chatbot recruiting assistant. It uses NLP and machine learning to automate recruiting processes. This type of chatbot automation is a must-have for all big companies. Especially the ones that receive more than a million job applications every year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies like L’Oréal use it to reduce the workload of their HR department. With some great results. The initial screening helps to filter out the most promising candidates. They can later be reached by HR professionals to finalize the recruitment process. Mya does 75% of the job and can process huge volumes of data.\n\n\n\n19. Mondly: Learning Bot\n\n\n\nMondly is a language learning platform that focuses on interactive online lessons. As Mondly’s developers claim: The new generation of learning should be about gamified, immersive experiences that always make the users crave for more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts chatbot uses speech recognition technology but you can also stick to writing. The chatbot encourages users to practice their English, Spanish, German, or French. \n\n\n\nYou can access several everyday role-playing scenarios, such as hotel booking or dining at a restaurant. Apart from its regular conversational chatbot, Mondly released a VR app for Oculus. The 3D environment helps to improve the level of user engagement.\n\n\n\n20. Visual Dialog Chatbot\n\n\n\nVisual Dialog is a visual chatbot that can interpret images. The chatbot uses computer vision and AI neural network technologies.\n\n\n\nUsers can upload images directly through the chat window. The Visual Dialog chatbot will send a message describing what’s in the picture. Often to quite hilarious effects. Playing around with Visual Dialog can be very entertaining and addictive.\n\n\n\nYou can try out the image recognition chatbot here\n\n\n\nImage recognition features are sometimes used in eCommerce chatbots as well. Visual chatbots are sometimes employed by popular brands, such as Nike. For example, you can take a picture and a bot will recommend several color-matching items.\n\n\n\n21. Globe Telecom Bot\n\n\n\nWhile projects like Roo get the most public attention and media coverage, chatbots are mainly used to streamline business processes. \n\n\n\nFor example, Globe Telecom—a provider of telecommunications services in the Philippines—has over 62 million customers. The daily volume of their customer service inquiries is massive.\n\n\n\nSo, they added a chatbot to their Facebook profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk to Globe Telecom chatbot now\n\n\n\n\nTheir results?\n\n\n\nThe company managed to reduce the number of calls by 50% and increased its team’s productivity threefold. Oh, and the customer satisfaction went up too.\n\n\n\n22. Chirpy Cardinal Chatterbot\n\n\n\nThis chatbot had been developed by Stanford University for the Alexa Prize competition. Chirpy Cardinal took second place. It uses advanced neural networks and focuses on creating engaging conversational experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk to Chirpy Cardinal now\n\n\n\n\nChirpy Cardinal utilizes the concept of mixed-initiative chat and asks a lot of questions. While the constant questioning may feel forced at times, the chatbot will surprise you with some of its strikingly accurate messages.\n\n\n\n23. Siri by Apple\n\n\n\nIs Siri a chatbot? Well, virtual assistants are a separate breed of chatbots. But they are chatbots nevertheless. And some of the most popular ones too.\n\n\n\nSiri is available across all devices with iOS—like iPhones, iPads, or Macbooks. With over 1 billion iPhones alone, Siri has the highest number of active users—far more than Google Assistant, Alexa, or Cortana.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need an Apple device with iOS to try out Siri\n\n\n\n\nUnlike Chirpy Cardinal, who wants to chat for the sake of chatting, Siri is more concerned with getting things done. It won’t ask you random questions out of the blue. You can think about Siri as a voice-based computer interface rather than a separate entity you can talk to for fun. Still, Apple’s virtual assistant does tell jokes. If you ask it nicely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24. LaMDA: AI Bot Engine\n\n\n\nLaMDA was created by Google and is an improved version of the Meena chatbot. Let’s decipher the name of this AI bot. It stands for “Language Model for Dialogue Applications.” It is the most sensible chatbot up to date. And it can carry on a conversation about any topic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis AI can judge how well a given message fits within the context of the entire conversation. This sounds like something basic. But even the most advanced chatbots get confused during seemingly simple conversations. Getting rid of the context switch issues is a huge step.\n\n\n\n25. Meet Einstein Bot\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has patented technology that will create chatbots based on people who have died. The software is going to analyze social media messages of the deceased and resurrect them as chatbots. Sounds like something out of a sci-fi horror but we’ll see how it turns out.\n\n\n\nFor now, we can talk to Albert Einstein who has also been brought back to life, thanks to UneeQ Digital Humans. The company used the character of a famous scientist to promote their app for creating AI chatbots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk to Einstein chatbot now\n\n\n\n\nThe project was created to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Einstein’s Nobel Prize. Now millions of people can ask him what is 5 + 5 and how to make an omelet. It’s hard not to ask yourself if poor old Albert would consider this a technological miracle or being condemned to an eternity of virtual torment.\n\n\n\n26. Pepper by Softbank\n\n\n\nApart from virtual chatbots, there are also physical ones. Everyone has heard of voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, Cortana, or Echo. But there are also some interesting chatting robot examples. Softbank’s Pepper is one of them.\n\n\n\nPepper is a humanoid robot that can chat with people. It is very popular in Japan and used in banks, hotels, or restaurants. Pepper combines physical and digital solutions to provide better customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPepper’s design is based on the idea that emotional engagement helps to build an excellent customer experience. The chatting robot is proactive, cute, and friendly. It can also analyze different voice tones and facial expressions to show empathy.\n\n\n\nRead more: Discover the best real-life chatbot use cases that your business can put into practice.\n\n\n\nMore chatbot examples\n\n\n\nFor online businesses, messaging customers is one of the most time-consuming tasks.
