Yet, leveraging cutting-edge technologies makes it achievable.\n\n\n\nAnd leaders in the field know it!\n\n\n\nEndeksa, a predictive real estate data analytics and insights platform operating in Turkey, Spain, and Portugal, uses real-time chat to transform customer service. This company started using Tidio to personalize the visitor experience by sending customized messages based on their client’s behavior. \n\n\n\nThe owners tested many platforms before Tidio, but the pricing of the systems needed to be lowered for the large number of users Endeksa has. \n\n\n\n\n\n    Tidio is cheaper than other platforms but still works marvelously.\n    \n        \n        \n          \n              Görkem Öğüt              CEO & Founding Partner of Endeksa           \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nLet’s discover more about Endeksa and how Tidio helps them achieve great results.\n\n\n\nKnow the value of your property\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation about the company:\n\n\n\n\nIndustry: PropTech\n\n\n\nStarted year: 2017\n\n\n\nSize: 100+ employees\n\n\n\nCountry of origin/headquarters: Turkey\n\n\n\nTidio products/tactics used: live chat and chatbots\n\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence, big data analysis, and machine learning continue to gain importance in the real estate sector. Endeksa utilizes these digital technologies in real estate valuation and serves as a reference point for all stakeholders. \n\n\n\nEndeksa, with a user base of over 300,000 and over 5 million e-valuations completed, analyzes properties based on several variables, such as location and structural features. Then, the platform predicts how long it will take to sell the house and at what price. It’s the first platform in Turkey to offer automated real estate valuation technology.\n\n\n\nThe challenges Endeksa faced\n\n\n\nThe company struggled with endless phone calls and needed a platform to manage communication with over 400,000 users. \n\n\n\nThe owners tested a variety of systems but they proved to be too expensive for the functionality they provided. The bill started to grow, but the benefits they got from the platform stayed the same.\n\n\n\nThe solution to this problem? \n\n\n\nSetting up customer service automation to save time, while boosting lead generation.\n\n\n\n1. Efficient query routing slashes response time\n\n\n\nSince Endeksa implemented Tidio, the waiting time for any customer question has decreased by 59%. \n\n\n\nHow?\n\n\n\nThe company created two umbrellas for the queries. The first one is customer service, and the second one is sales. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis helped Endeksa route the tickets based on their content so that the client’s conversation gets picked up by the right team member. Customers get their queries resolved quicker and more efficiently, improving their service satisfaction.\n\n\n\n2. Smart pre-chat surveys contribute to a boost in lead generation\n\n\n\nThe real estate data platform also experienced a 138% increase in leads since subscribing to the Tidio+ plan. \n\n\n\nThe pre-chat surveys make collecting new prospects easy. The company uses them to obtain the visitor’s name, phone number, and email address. And it’s proven to be an effective strategy for growing leads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Leveraging customer feedback to increase helpfulness and customer satisfaction\n\n\n\nEndeksa added a bot that asks users whether they’re satisfied with the proposed evaluation of their real estate. And this chatbot reaches an 88% helpfulness rate. \n\n\n\nThe company also automatically asks for customer feedback so they can act on it. There has been an overall increase of 10% in satisfaction rate since Endeksa started using the Tidio+ plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, clients are happy. But so is the brand. \n\n\n\nThe quality and share of the conversations taken by the bots satisfy the owners. But the chatbots also help to direct the customers to the right representative by asking basic questions on the topic of the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\n    We needed the most sustainable and efficient way to manage the traffic and improve customer satisfaction. So we implemented Tidio chatbot technology.\n    \n        \n        \n          \n              Görkem Öğüt              CEO & Founding Partner of Endeksa           \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\nFocus on confidence\n\n\n\nTidio provides analytics that help Endeksa keep an eye on their results at all times. On top of that, the brand offers real-time customer support, answers any questions promptly, and allows clients to share their feedback.\n\n\n\nThese help Endeksa gain trust and give visitors the confidence that the company is the right choice for their real estate needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Confidence is not an easy thing to accomplish during the real estate sale operation, so we focus on that area.\n    \n        \n        \n          \n              Görkem Öğüt              CEO & Founding Partner of Endeksa           \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\nAre you looking for a tool to boost your lead generation and slash response times?\n\n\n\nNo need to look any further.
