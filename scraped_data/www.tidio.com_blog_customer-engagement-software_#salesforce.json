It offers in-depth reporting and analytical insight so you can get a full picture of your customers and at what point they are in the customer journey. On top of that, it enhances agent productivity as service teams can eliminate some of the repetitive tasks by automating workflows, thus freeing them up to scale their service efforts.\n\n\n\nWith this in mind—\n\n\n\nLet’s identify the features your customer engagement software should have. \n\n\n\nWhat to look for in customer engagement software \n\n\n\nIf you are having trouble deciding on a customer engagement software for your website, here are some of the main features you need to consider:\n\n\n\n\nOmnichannel communication tools—customer engagement software should include relevant communication channels like live chat, email, social media, voice, and more. A report on retail trends has shown that over 50% of consumers feel it’s important to enjoy personalized experiences across all communication channels within a brand. \n\n\n\nUser feedback collection—a good engagement platform allows your service teams to solicit, collect, analyze, and respond to consumer feedback. A survey shows that companies that successfully engage consumers receive a 55% higher profitability. \n\n\n\nCustomer segmentation features—identify software that can segment your audience according to metrics such as demography, location, and behaviors. This allows you to personalize communications to consumers, increasing your chances of engagement. A study shows that personalization influences over 38% of online revenue. \n\n\n\n\nGet your support to another level with customer engagement software\n\n\n\nFinding the right customer engagement software is crucial to connecting your business to consumers. With the help of the right tool, you’ll be able to offer better service delivery and ultimately boost client engagement and satisfaction.\n\n\n\nTidio enhances customer support across multiple channels and streamlines operational efficiency by deploying chatbots and helpdesk workflows.
