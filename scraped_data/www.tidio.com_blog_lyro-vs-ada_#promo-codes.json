But how do Tidio’s Lyro and Ada software stack up against each other, and which one is the optimal choice for your brand?\n\n\n\nTo shed light on this comparison, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of both tools. Tune in as we unveil the results of our head-to-head analysis.\n\n\n\nIn this article, we’ll compare Tidio vs Ada CX based on the following categories:\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\n\nProduct availability\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\nFree shipping\n\n\n\nPromo codes\n\n\n\nPromo codes not working\n\n\n\nProduct sizing\n\n\n\nProduct questions\n\n\n\nOrder status\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this article is to compare Lyro vs Ada chat based on a number of scenarios. In this experiment we wanted to check how the chatbots are processing human-like conversations and answer commonly asked questions for ecommerce sites. \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Discover how Lyro can help your business grow\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about AI chatbots        \n            \n\n\n\n\nHere are the questions we presented Lyro AI and Ada chatbot software for each category:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo—\n\n\n\nLet’s get into the comparison.\n\n\n\nThe test was run on publicly available data from an ecommerce store Shapermint. We used the data from the shop’s help center and we uploaded them to Lyro. Ada solution is currently installed on the storefront.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic #1: Returns\n\n\n\nWe asked the AI systems What’s your return policy if the dress I buy doesn’t fit or look as expected? Do I need to pay for the return shipping?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they responded:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nAda CX ★★★★★\n\n\n\nBoth bots addressed the questions regarding the return policy without any problems, showing the capability to comprehend multiple inquiries simultaneously.\n\n\n\nTopic #2: Product availability\n\n\n\nUp next Tidio’s Lyro and Ada bot received a question Is the MVP polo 6 pack in stock?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they responded:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★☆\n\n\n\nAda CX ★☆☆☆☆\n\n\n\nThanks to Tidio’s integration with Shopify, Lyro seamlessly provided confirmation that the product was indeed available in stock, promptly guiding the user to the product page. In contrast, Ada conversational AI, struggled to understand the question, leaving us without a response and only the option to engage with a live chat agent. \n\n\n\nNote: Please note that product availability statuses in Tidio work exclusively for Shopify merchants.\n\n\n\nTopic #3: Shipping\n\n\n\nThen, we asked the AI tools Do you ship to Canada? How about Belarus? \n\n\n\nHere’s how they responded:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nAda CX ★★★★☆\n\n\n\nBoth bots handled the questions well. However, Lyro distinguished itself by adeptly maintaining context and customizing its response to address the question directly. In contrast, Ada AI Agent tended to offer a more generalized response. We perceive Lyro’s approach as more like a human agent would handle such situations. \n\n\n\nTopic #4: Free shipping\n\n\n\nFor this scenario Lyro and Ada tool got a question When free shipping is applied?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nAda CX ☆☆☆☆☆\n\n\n\nLyro provided an answer to the question seamlessly without encountering any difficulties. At the same time, the Ada AI Agent bot struggled to grasp the context of the question despite our attempts to rephrase it. \n\n\n\nTopic #5: Promo codes\n\n\n\nNext, we asked the AI systems Are there any ongoing discounts for first-time customers? and checked the responses.\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nAda CX ★★★★★\n\n\n\nBoth bots were able to answer the questions without encountering any issues.\n\n\n\nDid you know that…\n\n\n\nThanks to an integration with your online store and Lyro Tasks, you can now use Tidio to distribute custom codes to your website visitors.\n\n\n\nTopic #6: Promo codes not working\n\n\n\nLyro and Ada AI chatbot were later asked a question My promo code is not working, can you help me?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ☆☆☆☆☆\n\n\n\nAda CX ☆☆☆☆☆\n\n\n\nIt appears that we lacked sufficient information on the topic from the brand. In such cases, both bot solutions provided the option to chat with a live agent to resolve the issue.\n\n\n\nTopic #7: Product sizing\n\n\n\nWe then asked a more shopping assistant-type of question, Can you advise me about the size I should buy?.\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nAda CX ★★★★★\n\n\n\nBoth bots provided correct answers to the question. Lyro went the extra mile by sending a link to the FAQ page containing all measurements and a detailed explanation on how to find the best fit. In contrast, Ada system opted to ask follow-up questions to address the specifics of individual products.\n\n\n\nTopic #8: Product questions\n\n\n\nWhat about product recommendations, can AI handle those? We checked that by asking Lyro and Ada chat Can you recommend a product for gift, that’s under $30?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ☆☆☆☆☆\n\n\n\nAda CX ☆☆☆☆☆\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, due to the lack of knowledge or troubleshooting materials provided by the brand, both bots were unable to offer an answer. Ada CX bot seemed to struggle to understand the question entirely, offering suggestions unrelated to the topic. Conversely, Lyro promptly suggested an option to speak with a live operator.\n\n\n\nTopic #9: Order status\n\n\n\nLast but not least, the systems received a question What is my order status?\n\n\n\nHere’s how they handled it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nLyro ★★★★★\n\n\n\nAda CX ★★★★★\n\n\n\nBoth bots were ready to assist the website visitor with checking the order status through the bot, thanks to deeper integration with the shop.\n\n\n\nSummary: AI battle Lyro vs Ada CX\n\n\n\nTidio’s Lyro AI chatbot emerged as the winner in this battle, demonstrating superior performance across various support scenarios. Lyro proved its effectiveness in handling customer queries efficiently and clearly, comprehending the questions better and giving answers as live human agents would.\n\n\n\nHere’s a comparison table between the two software:\n\n\n\nCategoryLyroAdaReturns✅✅Product availability✅❌ShippingQuestion ✅Question ✅Free shipping✅❌Promo codes✅✅Promo codes not working❌❌Product sizing✅✅Product questions❌❌Order status✅✅\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Take Lyro for a test drive\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about AI chatbots        \n            \n\n\n\n\nSee you in the next round!\nShare this article:Beata StefanowiczContent Writer at Tidio with a love for the written word.
