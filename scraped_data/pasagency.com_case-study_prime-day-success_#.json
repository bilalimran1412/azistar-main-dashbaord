With Prime Day being a crucial event for sales, ensuring that the inventory was sufficient, logistics were well-managed, and Prime deals were effectively handled posed significant hurdles.\nTo address these challenges, our team utilized Amazon’s internal datasets, including search query performance reports, alongside external tools such as Helium 10 and Data Rova. This approach allowed us to focus on hyper-relevant, intent-based keywords for targeting potential new customers.\nTHE SOLUTION\n\n\nTo address these challenges, several key strategies were employed. Firstly, the team focused on staying ahead of the competition by knowing the date of Prime Day earlier than 90% of other sellers. This allowed for better planning and preparation.\nLogistically, efforts were made to streamline the ordering process and prepare the warehouse well in advance. Catalog optimization was also a key focus, ensuring that the right products were promoted and easily accessible to customers.\nRegarding Prime deal management, SKUs were prioritized based on their potential for high sales and profitability. Profit calculations were done meticulously to ensure that deals were profitable.\nFinally, a 48-hour deal management plan was implemented to handle the surge in traffic and orders during the Prime Day event.\nTHE  RESULT\n\n\n 92% UTIZAION OF  DEDICATED  SKU  INVENTORY\n309% INCREASE IN  YOY PRIME DAY  RESULT\nGEMERATED $542K ,IN  60 HOURS\nCONTACT US\n\n\nPhone\n\n(561)-464-5333\n\nWebsite\n\nwww.pasagency.com\n\nMail\n\ninfo@pasagency.com \n\nLocation\n\n20283 FL-7, Boca Raton, FL 33498\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Name *Last Name *Phone *Email *Your Seller Display Name* *Link to one of your products or brand store on Amazon*What’s the main reason for contact?What’s the main reason for contact?I`m Looking to update my creativesI`m concerned about my advertising perfomanceI`m looking for catlog managementI want to launch on AmazonI`m lookjing for a full-service managementMy current agency is to expensiveSEND  \n \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us OnLink to FacebookLink to LinkedInLink to Instagram\n\n\nStart your Project WITH US\nReady to start your Audit?\n\n\n\nSTART YOUR AUDIT\n\n\nLet’s Contact\n\n\n\n+1 (561) 464-533\ninfo@pasagency.com\n20283 FL-7, Boca Raton, FL 33498\n\n\n\nWhat We do\n\n\n\nFull Account Management\nSEO and Listing Optimization\nPPC Campaign Management\nCreatives and Graphic Design\n\n\n\n\nListing Reinstatement\nRefunds and Reimbursement \nGrowth Strategy and Consultation\n\n\n\nWho We Are\nAbout Us\nOur Team\n\n\n\nResources\nBlog\nCase Studies\n\n \t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n\n                        © 2024, Copyright PAS Agency\n\n                        Cookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\n\n                    \n\n\t            \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\nScroll to top"
