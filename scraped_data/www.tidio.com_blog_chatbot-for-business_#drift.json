They have no problem answering the same question asked by customers for 10th or 100th time.\n\n\n\nThat’s why they are gaining popularity these days—they are better, faster, and a cheaper solution.\n\n\n\nIn this article, we will explore how to use them to your benefit.\n\n\n\nIn this article:\n\n\n\n\nHow are chatbots used in business?\n\n\n\nWhat is the best chatbot for business?\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Satisfy your customers with the best chatbots for your business\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\n\n\n\nIf you want to explore chatbots first-hand, here are some additional resources you may find useful:\n\n\n\n\nBest AI Chatbot Platforms [Free & Paid]\n\n\n\nTop WordPress Chatbot Plugins for Your Website\n\n\n\nPopular Chatbot Apps for Android and iOS Compared\n\n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nAre you ready to examine how chatbot technology can be used for business purposes?\n\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at different ways of implementing chatbot technology and some business chatbot use cases.\n\n\n\nHow to use chatbots for business\n\n\n\nIf you want to use chatbots for business, you first need to add a live chat to your website and social media. Then, create a conversational AI bot and activate it in your live chat widget. You can make your own bots for your business by using a chatbot builder. Popular chatbot providers offer many chatbot designs and templates to choose from.\n\n\n\nIf you’re comfortable designing your own dialog trees and chatbot workflows, making a chatbot from scratch may be the best choice for you. However, if you’re looking for a more simple and straightforward solution, then choosing ready-to-use chatbot templates may be a better option.\n\n\n\nNow—\n\n\n\nHere are a few chatbot business strategies and examples of how chatbots have proven to be successful for companies.\n\n\n\n1. Use chatbot to resolve FAQs\n\n\n\nChatbots work 24/7 without complaining or lengthy customer service training sessions. This is important as 55% of users will likely abandon online purchases if they don’t receive quick answers to their questions.\n\n\n\nSo, the tech is here. We are way past the “Hello. IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?” routine. There is really no excuse for making your customer wait and your agents answer repetitive questions over and over again.\n\n\n\nHere is an example of an AI chatbot used by Bella Sante:\n\n\n\nThis med spa company was able to achieve 75% of live chat customer service automation with Lyro, Tidio’s AI-powered chatbot. \n\n\n\nLyro uses artificial intelligence technology to pull questions from the FAQ page and answer them in a conversational manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Lyro provides answers to the most frequently asked questions on autopilot, Bella Sante customers have their info instantly, and their waiting times are significantly reduced.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn the benefits, types, and use cases of a FAQ chatbot.\n\n\n\n2. Collect customer data and user feedback\n\n\n\nChatbots can either collect customer feedback passively through conversations or actively through surveys. The passive method can be very discreet—for example, a chatbot can tag customers who use specific phrases or product names. The second approach, chatbot surveys, is more explicit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth types of bots can be extremely useful for understanding what your customers want and how they feel about your company. But it’s important to design your chatbot surveys carefully, so you can get the most accurate information possible.\n\n\n\nRead more: Find out the best customer satisfaction survey questions. \n\n\n\n3. Give personalized product recommendations\n\n\n\nOne of the most successful examples of using chatbots for business is providing personalized recommendations.  Ecommerce chatbots can automatically recognize customers, offer personalized messages, and even address visitors by their first names. You can easily set up separate chatbots for new customers, returning customers, or shoppers who are abandoning shopping carts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how does this type of chatbot work in practice? Well, you can configure your chatbot to keep track of the products your customers have viewed or bought in the past. Then, bots will make future recommendations based on that data. You can also go through conversations and your customer database to create several client profiles. For example, new and returning customers may receive two very different welcome messages.\n\n\n\nRead more: Learn how eye-oo boosted revenue after installing Tidio.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Create personalized shopping experiences with Tidio business chatbots\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    Get started for free            \n\n                            \n                        Get a demo                \n                    \n                \n                Learn more about chat flows        \n            \n\n\n\n\n4. Qualify leads with lead generation chatbots\n\n\n\nOne of the best features of chatbots, business-wise, is their ability to generate and qualify leads. The easiest way to encourage visitors to leave an email or phone number is by offering something in return. Chatbots can provide discount codes or other lead magnets.\n\n\n\nIf you’re feeling extra lazy, you can even try to convince visitors to leave their contact information so they can start a conversation with the bot in the first place. For example, you can collect data with Tidio pre-chat surveys.\n\n\n\nBut bots nowadays can act as customer segmentation tools and qualify leads. Ask some questions about your visitor’s needs to discover who is your potential customer and who isn’t.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe example above shows a chatbot powered by Drift. It asks potential customers about their business goals and assigns them to specific customer service or sales agents. People are much more likely to talk about their needs and goals when asked by a cute bot than by a random popup.\n\n\n\nRead more: See the best use cases of lead generation chatbots.\n\n\n\n5. Weaponize social media for conversational sales\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to online marketing, you need to have a strategy for acquiring customers. One of the most effective ways to do this is through social media and paid advertising. However, you can’t just put up an ad and expect people to buy from you. You need to know where you want to redirect their focus to.\n\n\n\nOur suggestion? Try conversational sales with Facebook Messenger bots for business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, custom landing pages used to be the best way to make the most of your paid traffic. But chatbots and conversational landing pages convert 20% better than static landing pages.\n\n\n\nWith PPC, it is especially important to maximize the potential of your traffic. Using ads that send customers straight to your Messenger or WhatsApp chatbots is a fool-proof marketing strategy.\n\n\n\nRead more: Find out the best Instagram bots you can use to increase likes and followers. Also, be sure to check out a complete guide on Facebook chatbots.\n\n\n\n6. Reduce the number of abandoned shopping carts\n\n\n\nMany businesses have a hard time understanding why anyone would abandon their cart. The answer is that people get overwhelmed easily. And they bounce when they are bombarded with too many steps or when they come across complications in the checkout process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatbots can help reduce shopping cart abandonment rates by giving customers personalized assistance throughout the purchase process. For example, if a customer needs more information before making their decision, a chatbot can offer assistance and guidance to help them complete their purchase.\n\n\n\nRead more: Check out the essential shopping cart abandonment statistics and KPIs. And while you’re at it, explore the best strategies for shopping cart abandonment.\n\n\n\n7. Integrate bots for omnichannel communication\n\n\n\nIn the past, customer service usually happened over the phone. But now, multichannel customer service combines popular messaging apps, social networks, email and SMS texting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatbots can interact with customers on multiple channels simultaneously. With the click of a button, you can create one version of the bot for a website and then duplicate it for Messenger or Instagram. This allows businesses to provide a more uniform customer experience across different customer journey touchpoints.\n\n\n\n\n    Did you know…    Chatbots enjoy a much higher message response rate than emails. The average engagement rate for chatbots is around 10% (measured as the click-through rate for all website visitors). For email marketing, it’s below 3%.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the best business chatbot for websites and online stores?\n\n\n\nChatbot pricing can be prohibitive, and you may not have the resources or expertise to do it yourself. That’s why so many small and medium-sized businesses are turning to plugin-based chatbot platforms and services. \n\n\n\nThese solutions allow you to create and manage your chatbot without any programming knowledge. They often come with a wide range of features and integrations. Some of them also have JavaScript APIs that give you full control over your bot messages and widget behavior.\n\n\n\nHere are some of the best providers of AI chatbots for small businesses:\n\n\n\nBusiness chatbotsG2 Rating Free planBest forTidio4.7/5 ⭐️✅AI-powered chatbotsChatfuel4.5/5 ⭐️Free trialAutomationsBotsify4.2/5 ⭐️Free trialChatbot builderDrift4.4/5 ⭐️❌Lead qualification feature\n\n\n\n1.
